In 1895, military defeat forced China's Qing Dynasty to cede Taiwan to Japan, which then governed Taiwan for 50 years. Taiwan came under Chinese Nationalist (Kuomintang, KMT) control after World War II. With the communist victory in the Chinese civil war in 1949, the Nationalist-controlled Republic of China government and 2 million Nationalists fled to Taiwan and continued to claim to be the legitimate government for mainland China and Taiwan based on a 1947 Constitution drawn up for all of China. Until 1987, however, the Nationalist government ruled Taiwan under a civil war martial law declaration dating to 1948. Beginning in the 1970s, Nationalist authorities gradually began to incorporate the native population into the governing structure beyond the local level. The democratization process expanded rapidly in the 1980s, leading to the then illegal founding of Taiwan&rsquo;s first opposition party (the Democratic Progressive Party or DPP) in 1986 and the lifting of martial law the following year. Taiwan held legislative elections in 1992, the first in over forty years, and its first direct presidential election in 1996. In the 2000 presidential elections, Taiwan underwent its first peaceful transfer of power with the KMT loss to the DPP and afterwards experienced two additional democratic transfers of power in 2008 and 2016. Throughout this period, the island prospered, became one of East Asia's economic \"Tigers,\" and after 2000 became a major investor in mainland China as cross-Strait ties matured. The dominant political issues continue to be economic reform and growth as well as management of sensitive relations between Taiwan and China."}],"comparative":false},{"title":"Geography","fields":[{"title":"Location","comparative":false,"field_id":"276","definition":"This entry identifies the country's regional location, neighboring countries, and adjacent bodies of water.","id":"location","content":"Eastern Asia, islands bordering the East China Sea, Philippine Sea, South China Sea, and Taiwan Strait, north of the Philippines, off the southeastern coast of China"},{"title":"Geographic coordinates","comparative":false,"field_id":"277","definition":"This entry includes rounded latitude and longitude figures for the centroid or center point of a country expressed in degrees and minutes; it is based on the locations provided in the Geographic Names Server (GNS), maintained by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency on behalf of the US Board on Geographic Names.","id":"geographic-coordinates","content":"23 30 N, 121 00 E"},{"title":"Map references","comparative":false,"field_id":"278","definition":"This entry includes the name of the <em>Factbook</em> reference map on which a country may be found.

this sovereignty extends to the air space over the territorial sea as well as its underlying seabed and subsoil; every state has the right to establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not exceeding 12 nautical miles; the normal baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the mean low-water line along the coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the coastal state; where the coasts of two states are opposite or adjacent to each other, neither state is entitled to extend its territorial sea beyond the median line, every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the baseline from which the territorial seas of both states are measured; the UNCLOS describes specific rules for archipelagic states.<br /> <br /><em>contiguous zone</em> - according to the UNCLOS (Article 33), this is a zone contiguous to a coastal state's territorial sea, over which it may exercise the control necessary to: prevent infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory or territorial sea; punish infringement of the above laws and regulations committed within its territory or territorial sea; the contiguous zone may not extend beyond 24 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured (e.g., the US has claimed a 12-nautical mile contiguous zone in addition to its 12-nautical mile territorial sea); where the coasts of two states are opposite or adjacent to each other, neither state is entitled to extend its contiguous zone beyond the median line, every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the baseline from which the contiguous zone of both states are measured.<br /> <br /><em>exclusive economic zone (EEZ)</em> - the UNCLOS (Part V) defines the EEZ as a zone beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea in which a coastal state has: sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources, whether living or non-living, of the waters superjacent to the seabed and of the seabed and its subsoil, and with regard to other activities for the economic exploitation and exploration of the zone, such as the production of energy from the water, currents, and winds; jurisdiction with regard to the establishment and use of artificial islands, installations, and structures; marine scientific research; the protection and preservation of the marine environment; the outer limit of the exclusive economic zone shall not exceed 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.<br /> <br /><em>continental shelf</em> - the UNCLOS (Article 76) defines the continental shelf of a coastal state as comprising the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance; the continental margin comprises the submerged prolongation of the landmass of the coastal state, and consists of the seabed and subsoil of the shelf, the slope and the rise; wherever the continental margin extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baseline, coastal states may extend their claim to a distance not to exceed 350 nautical miles from the baseline or 100 nautical miles from the 2,500-meter isobath, which is a line connecting points of 2,500 meters in depth; it does not include the deep ocean floor with its oceanic ridges or the subsoil thereof.<br /> <br /><em>exclusive fishing zone</em> - while this term is not used in the UNCLOS, some states (e.g., the United Kingdom) have chosen not to claim an EEZ but rather to claim jurisdiction over the living resources off their coast; in such cases, the term exclusive fishing zone is often used; the breadth of this zone is normally the same as the EEZ or 200 nautical miles.","id":"maritime-claims","content":"<strong>territorial sea: </strong>12 nm<br><br><strong>exclusive economic zone: </strong>200 nm"},{"title":"Climate","comparative":false,"field_id":"284","definition":"This entry includes a brief description of typical weather regimes throughout the year;

The core characteristics and beliefs of the world's major religions are described below. <br /><strong>Baha'i</strong> - Founded by Mirza Husayn-Ali (known as Baha'u'llah) in Iran in 1852, Baha'i faith emphasizes monotheism and believes in one eternal transcendent God. Its guiding focus is to encourage the unity of all peoples on the earth so that justice and peace may be achieved on earth. Baha'i revelation contends the prophets of major world religions reflect some truth or element of the divine, believes all were manifestations of God given to specific communities in specific times, and that Baha'u'llah is an additional prophet meant to call all humankind. Bahais are an open community, located worldwide, with the greatest concentration of believers in South Asia. <br /><strong>Buddhism</strong> - Religion or philosophy inspired by the 5th century B.C. teachings of Siddhartha Gautama (also known as Gautama Buddha \"the enlightened one\"). Buddhism focuses on the goal of spiritual enlightenment centered on an understanding of Gautama Buddha's Four Noble Truths on the nature of suffering, and on the Eightfold Path of spiritual and moral practice, to break the cycle of suffering of which we are a part. Buddhism ascribes to a karmic system of rebirth. Several schools and sects of Buddhism exist, differing often on the nature of the Buddha, the extent to which enlightenment can be achieved (for one or for all) and by whom (religious orders or laity). <br /><em>Basic Groupings</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theravada Buddhism: The oldest Buddhist school, Theravada is practiced mostly in Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos, Burma, and Thailand, with minority representation elsewhere in Asia and the West. Theravadans follow the Pali Canon of Buddha's teachings, and believe that one may escape the cycle of rebirth, worldly attachment, and suffering for oneself; this process may take one or several lifetimes. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahayana Buddhism, including subsets Zen and Tibetan (Lamaistic) Buddhism: Forms of Mahayana Buddhism are common in East Asia and Tibet, and parts of the West. Mahayanas have additional scriptures beyond the Pali Canon and believe the Buddha is eternal and still teaching. Unlike Theravada Buddhism, Mahayana schools maintain the Buddha-nature is present in all beings and all will ultimately achieve enlightenment. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoa Hao: a minority tradition of Buddhism practiced in Vietnam that stresses lay participation, primarily by peasant farmers; it eschews expensive ceremonies and temples and relocates the primary practices into the home.<br /><strong>Christianity</strong> - Descending from Judaism, Christianity's central belief maintains Jesus of Nazareth is the promised messiah of the Hebrew Scriptures, and that his life, death, and resurrection are salvific for the world. Christianity is one of the three monotheistic Abrahamic faiths, along with Islam and Judaism, which traces its spiritual lineage to Abraham of the Hebrew Scriptures. Its sacred texts include the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament (or the Christian Gospels). <br /><em>Basic Groupings</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catholicism (or Roman Catholicism): This is the oldest established western Christian church and the world's largest single religious body. It is supranational, and recognizes a hierarchical structure with the Pope, or Bishop of Rome, as its head, located at the Vatican. Catholics believe the Pope is the divinely ordered head of the Church from a direct spiritual legacy of Jesus' apostle Peter. Catholicism is comprised of 23 particular Churches, or Rites - one Western (Roman or Latin-Rite) and 22 Eastern. The Latin Rite is by far the largest, making up about 98% of Catholic membership. Eastern-Rite Churches, such as the Maronite Church and the Ukrainian Catholic Church, are in communion with Rome although they preserve their own worship traditions and their immediate hierarchy consists of clergy within their own rite. The Catholic Church has a comprehensive theological and moral doctrine specified for believers in its catechism, which makes it unique among most forms of Christianity. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: The Church was organized in 1830 and teaches that it is the restoration of Jesus Christ's original church. It embraces salvation through Christ, personal revelation, and has an open canon, including the King James Bible and the Book of Mormon, which is another testament of Christ's divinity. The Book of Mormon maintains there was an appearance of Jesus in the New World following the Christian account of his resurrection, and that the Americas are uniquely blessed continents. The Church has a centralized doctrine and leadership structure, but has volunteer, lay clergy who oversee local congregations in 176 countries and territories.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jehovah's Witnesses structure their faith on the Christian Bible, but their rejection of the Trinity is distinct from mainstream Christianity. They believe that a Kingdom of God, the Theocracy, will emerge following Armageddon and usher in a new earthly society. Adherents are required to evangelize and to follow a strict moral code.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orthodox Christianity: The oldest established eastern form of Christianity, the Holy Orthodox Church, has a ceremonial head in the Bishop of Constantinople (Istanbul), also known as a Patriarch, but its various regional forms (e.g., Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Serbian Orthodox, Ukrainian Orthodox) are autocephalous (independent of Constantinople's authority, and have their own Patriarchs). Orthodox churches are highly nationalist and ethnic. The Orthodox Christian faith shares many theological tenets with the Roman Catholic Church, but diverges on some key premises and does not recognize the governing authority of the Pope. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protestant Christianity: Protestant Christianity originated in the 16th century as an attempt to reform Roman Catholicism's practices, dogma, and theology. It encompasses several forms or denominations which are extremely varied in structure, beliefs, relationship to national governments, clergy, and governance. Many protestant theologies emphasize the primary role of scripture in their faith, advocating individual interpretation of Christian texts without the mediation of a final religious authority such as the Roman Pope. The oldest Protestant denominations include Lutheranism, Calvinism (Presbyterianism), and Anglican Christianity (Episcopalianism), which have established liturgies, governing structure, and formal clergy. Other variants on Protestant Christianity, including Pentecostal movements and independent churches, may lack one or more of these elements, and their leadership and beliefs are individualized and dynamic. <br /><strong>Hinduism</strong> - Originating in the Vedic civilization of India (second and first millennium B.C.), Hinduism is an extremely diverse set of beliefs and practices with no single founder or religious authority. Hinduism has many scriptures; the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the Bhagavad-Gita are among some of the most important. Hindus may worship one or many deities, usually with prayer rituals within their own home. The most common figures of devotion are the gods Vishnu, Shiva, and a mother goddess, Devi. Most Hindus believe the soul, or <em>atman</em>, is eternal, and goes through a cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (<em>samsara</em>) determined by one's positive or negative karma, or the consequences of one's actions. The goal of religious life is to learn to act so as to finally achieve liberation (<em>moksha</em>) of one's soul, escaping the rebirth cycle. <br /><strong>Islam</strong> - One of the three monotheistic Abrahamic faiths, Islam originated with the teachings of Muhammad in the 7th century. Muslims believe Muhammad is the final of all religious prophets (beginning with Abraham) and that the Qu'ran, which is the Islamic scripture, was revealed to him by God. Islam derives from the word submission, and obedience to God is a primary theme in this religion. In order to live an Islamic life, believers must follow the five pillars, or tenets, of Islam, which are the testimony of faith (<em>shahada</em>), daily prayer (<em>salah</em>), giving alms (<em>zakah</em>), fasting during Ramadan (<em>sawm</em>), and the pilgrimage to Mecca (<em>hajj</em>). <br /><em>Basic Groupings</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two primary branches of Islam are Sunni and Shia, which split from each other over a religio-political leadership dispute about the rightful successor to Muhammad. The Shia believe Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, Ali, was the only divinely ordained Imam (religious leader), while the Sunni maintain the first three caliphs after Muhammad were also legitimate authorities. In modern Islam, Sunnis and Shia continue to have different views of acceptable schools of Islamic jurisprudence, and who is a proper Islamic religious authority. Islam also has an active mystical branch, Sufism, with various Sunni and Shia subsets. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sunni Islam accounts for over 87-90% of the world's Muslim population. It recognizes the Abu Bakr as the first caliph after Muhammad. Sunni has four schools of Islamic doctrine and law - Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali - which uniquely interpret the <em>Hadith</em>, or recorded oral traditions of Muhammad. A Sunni Muslim may elect to follow any one of these schools, as all are considered equally valid. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Shia Islam represents 10-13% of Muslims worldwide, and its distinguishing feature is its reverence for Ali as an infallible, divinely inspired leader, and as the first Imam of the Muslim community after Muhammad. A majority of Shia are known as \"Twelvers,\" because they believe that the 11 familial successor imams after Muhammad culminate in a 12th Imam (al-Mahdi) who is hidden in the world and will reappear at its end to redeem the righteous. <br /><em>Variants</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ismaili faith: A sect of Shia Islam, its adherents are also known as \"Seveners,\" because they believe that the rightful seventh Imam in Islamic leadership was Isma'il, the elder son of Imam Jafar al-Sadiq. Ismaili tradition awaits the return of the seventh Imam as the Mahdi, or Islamic messianic figure. Ismailis are located in various parts of the world, particularly South Asia and the Levant. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alawi faith: Another Shia sect of Islam, the name reflects followers' devotion to the religious authority of Ali. Alawites are a closed, secretive religious group who assert they are Shia Muslims, although outside scholars speculate their beliefs may have a syncretic mix with other faiths originating in the Middle East. Alawis live mostly in Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druze faith: A highly secretive tradition and a closed community that derives from the Ismaili sect of Islam; its core beliefs are thought to emphasize a combination of Gnostic principles believing that the Fatimid caliph, al-Hakin, is the one who embodies the key aspects of goodness of the universe, which are, the intellect, the word, the soul, the preceder, and the follower. The Druze have a key presence in Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. <br /><strong>Jainism</strong> - Originating in India, Jain spiritual philosophy believes in an eternal human soul, the eternal universe, and a principle of \"the own nature of things.\" It emphasizes compassion for all living things, seeks liberation of the human soul from reincarnation through enlightenment, and values personal responsibility due to the belief in the immediate consequences of one's behavior. Jain philosophy teaches non-violence and prescribes vegetarianism for monks and laity alike; its adherents are a highly influential religious minority in Indian society. <br /><strong>Judaism</strong> - One of the first known monotheistic religions, likely dating to between 2000-1500 B.C., Judaism is the native faith of the Jewish people, based upon the belief in a covenant of responsibility between a sole omnipotent creator God and Abraham, the patriarch of Judaism's Hebrew Bible, or <em>Tanakh</em>. Divine revelation of principles and prohibitions in the Hebrew Scriptures form the basis of Jewish law, or <em>halakhah</em>, which is a key component of the faith. While there are extensive traditions of Jewish halakhic and theological discourse, there is no final dogmatic authority in the tradition. Local communities have their own religious leadership. Modern Judaism has three basic categories of faith: Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform/Liberal. These differ in their views and observance of Jewish law, with the Orthodox representing the most traditional practice, and Reform/Liberal communities the most accommodating of individualized interpretations of Jewish identity and faith. <br /><strong>Shintoism</strong> - A native animist tradition of Japan, Shinto practice is based upon the premise that every being and object has its own spirit or <em>kami</em>. Shinto practitioners worship several particular <em>kamis</em>, including the <em>kamis</em> of nature, and families often have shrines to their ancestors' <em>kamis</em>. Shintoism has no fixed tradition of prayers or prescribed dogma, but is characterized by individual ritual. Respect for the <em>kamis</em> in nature is a key Shinto value. Prior to the end of World War II, Shinto was the state religion of Japan, and bolstered the cult of the Japanese emperor. <br /><strong>Sikhism</strong> - Founded by the Guru Nanak (born 1469), Sikhism believes in a non-anthropomorphic, supreme, eternal, creator God; centering one's devotion to God is seen as a means of escaping the cycle of rebirth. Sikhs follow the teachings of Nanak and nine subsequent gurus. Their scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib - also known as the Adi Granth - is considered the living Guru, or final authority of Sikh faith and theology. Sikhism emphasizes equality of humankind and disavows caste, class, or gender discrimination. <br /><strong>Taoism</strong> - Chinese philosophy or religion based upon Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching, which centers on belief in the Tao, or the way, as the flow of the universe and the nature of things. Taoism encourages a principle of non-force, or wu-wei, as the means to live harmoniously with the Tao. Taoists believe the esoteric world is made up of a perfect harmonious balance and nature, while in the manifest world - particularly in the body - balance is distorted. The Three Jewels of the Tao - compassion, simplicity, and humility - serve as the basis for Taoist ethics. <br /><strong>Zoroastrianism</strong> - Originating from the teachings of Zoroaster in about the 9th or 10th century B.C., Zoroastrianism may be the oldest continuing creedal religion. Its key beliefs center on a transcendent creator God, Ahura Mazda, and the concept of free will. The key ethical tenets of Zoroastrianism expressed in its scripture, the Avesta, are based on a dualistic worldview where one may prevent chaos if one chooses to serve God and exercises good thoughts, good words, and good deeds. Zoroastrianism is generally a closed religion and members are almost always born to Zoroastrian parents. Prior to the spread of Islam, Zoroastrianism dominated greater Iran. Today, though a minority, Zoroastrians remain primarily in Iran, India (where they are known as Parsi), and Pakistan. <br /><strong>Traditional beliefs</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Animism: the belief that non-human entities contain souls or spirits.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Badimo: a form of ancestor worship of the Tswana people of Botswana.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Confucianism: an ideology that humans are perfectible through self-cultivation and self-creation; developed from teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius. Confucianism has strongly influenced the culture and beliefs of East Asian countries, including China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Inuit beliefs: a form of shamanism (see below) based on the animistic principles of the Inuit or Eskimo peoples.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Kirant: the belief system of the Kirat, a people who live mainly in the Himalayas of Nepal. It is primarily a form of polytheistic shamanism, but includes elements of animism and ancestor worship. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pagan is a blanket term used to describe many unconnected belief practices throughout history, usually in reference to religions outside of the Abrahamic category (monotheistic faiths including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Shamanism: beliefs and practices promoting communication with the spiritual world. Shamanistic beliefs are organized around a shaman or medicine man who - as an intermediary between the human and spirit world - is believed to be able to heal the sick (by healing their souls), communicate with the spirit world, and help souls into the afterlife through the practice of entering a trance. In shaman-based religions, the shaman is also responsible for leading sacred rites.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Spiritualism: the belief that souls and spirits communicate with the living usually through intermediaries called mediums. <br /><strong>Syncretic</strong> (fusion of diverse religious beliefs and practices) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cao Dai: a nationalistic Vietnamese sect, officially established in 1926, that draws practices and precepts from Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Catholicism.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Chondogyo: or the religion of the Heavenly Way, is based on Korean shamanism, Buddhism, and Korean folk traditions, with some elements drawn from Christianity. Formulated in the 1860s, it holds that God lives in all of us and strives to convert society into a paradise on earth, populated by believers transformed into intelligent moral beings with a high social conscience.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Kimbanguism: a puritan form of the Baptist denomination founded by Simon Kimbangu in the 1920s in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Adherents believe that salvation comes through Jesus' death and resurrection, like Christianity, but additionally that living a spiritually pure life following strict codes of conduct is required for salvation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Modekngei: a hybrid of Christianity and ancient Palauan culture and oral traditions founded around 1915 on the island of Babeldaob. Adherents simultaneously worship Jesus Christ and Palauan goddesses. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rastafarianism: an afro-centrist ideology and movement based on Christianity that arose in Jamaica in the 1930s; it believes that Haile Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930-74, was the incarnation of the second coming of Jesus.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Santeria: practiced in Cuba, the merging of the Yoruba religion of Nigeria with Roman Catholicism and native Indian traditions. Its practitioners believe that each person has a destiny and eventually transcends to merge with the divine creator and source of all energy, Olorun. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Voodoo/Vodun: a form of spirit and ancestor worship combined with some Christian faiths, especially Catholicism. Haitian and Louisiana Voodoo, which have included more Catholic practices, are separate from West African Vodun, which has retained a focus on spirit worship. <br /><strong>Non-religious</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Agnosticism: the belief that most things are unknowable. In regard to religion, it is usually characterized as neither a belief nor non-belief in a deity.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Atheism: the belief that there are no deities of any kind.","id":"religions","content":"Buddhist 35.3%, Taoist 33.2%, Christian 3.9%, folk religion (includes Confucian) approximately 10%, none or unspecified 18.2% (2005 est.)"},{"title":"Age structure","comparative":false,"subfields_raw":"0-14 years, 15-24 years, 25-54 years, 55-64 years, 65 years and over","field_id":"341","definition":"This entry provides the distribution of the population according to age.

Dependency ratios contrast the ratio of youths (ages 0-14) and the elderly (ages 65+) to the number of those in the working-age group (ages 15-64). Changes in the dependency ratio provide an indication of potential social support requirements resulting from changes in population age structures. As fertility levels decline, the dependency ratio initially falls because the proportion of youths decreases while the proportion of the population of working age increases. As fertility levels continue to decline, dependency ratios eventually increase because the proportion of the population of working age starts to decline and the proportion of elderly persons continues to increase.<br /><br /><em>total dependency ratio</em> - The total dependency ratio is the ratio of combined youth population (ages 0-14) and elderly population (ages 65+) per 100 people of working age (ages 15-64). A high total dependency ratio indicates that the working-age population and the overall economy face a greater burden to support and provide social services for youth and elderly persons, who are often economically dependent.<br /><br /><em>youth dependency ratio</em> - The youth dependency ratio is the ratio of the youth population (ages 0-14) per 100 people of working age (ages 15-64). A high youth dependency ratio indicates that a greater investment needs to be made in schooling and other services for children.<br /><br /><em>elderly dependency ratio</em> - The elderly dependency ratio is the ratio of the elderly population (ages 65+) per 100 people of working age (ages 15-64). Increases in the elderly dependency ratio put added pressure on governments to fund pensions and healthcare.<br /><br /><em>potential support ratio</em> - The potential support ratio is the number of working-age people (ages 15-64) per one elderly person (ages 65+).

Low levels of literacy, and education in general, can impede the economic development of a country in the current rapidly changing, technology-driven world.","id":"literacy","content":"<strong>definition: </strong>age 15 and over can read and write<br><br><strong>total population: </strong>98.5%<br><br><strong>male: </strong>99.7%<br><br><strong>female: </strong>97.3% (2014)"}],"comparative":false},{"title":"Environment","fields":[{"title":"Environment - current issues","comparative":false,"field_id":"293","definition":"This entry lists the most pressing and important environmental problems. The following terms and abbreviations are used throughout the entry: <br /><strong>Acidification</strong> - the lowering of soil and water pH due to acid precipitation and deposition usually through precipitation; this process disrupts ecosystem nutrient flows and may kill freshwater fish and plants dependent on more neutral or alkaline conditions (see acid rain). <br /><strong>Acid rain</strong> - characterized as containing harmful levels of sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxide; acid rain is damaging and potentially deadly to the earth's fragile ecosystems; acidity is measured using the pH scale where 7 is neutral, values greater than 7 are considered alkaline, and values below 5.6 are considered acid precipitation; note - a pH of 2.4 (the acidity of vinegar) has been measured in rainfall in New England. <br /><strong>Aerosol</strong> - a collection of airborne particles dispersed in a gas, smoke, or fog. <br /><strong>Afforestation</strong> - converting a bare or agricultural space by planting trees and plants; reforestation involves replanting trees on areas that have been cut or destroyed by fire. <br /><strong>Asbestos</strong> - a naturally occurring soft fibrous mineral commonly used in fireproofing materials and considered to be highly carcinogenic in particulate form. <br /><strong>Biodiversity</strong> - also biological diversity; the relative number of species, diverse in form and function, at the genetic, organism, community, and ecosystem level; loss of biodiversity reduces an ecosystem's ability to recover from natural or man-induced disruption. <br /><strong>Bio-indicators</strong> - a plant or animal species whose presence, abundance, and health reveal the general condition of its habitat. <br /><strong>Biomass</strong> - the total weight or volume of living matter in a given area or volume. <br /><strong>Carbon cycle</strong> - the term used to describe the exchange of carbon (in various forms, e.g., as carbon dioxide) between the atmosphere, ocean, terrestrial biosphere, and geological deposits. <br /><strong>Catchments</strong> - assemblages used to capture and retain rainwater and runoff; an important water management technique in areas with limited freshwater resources, such as Gibraltar. <br /><strong>DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane)</strong> - a colorless, odorless insecticide that has toxic effects on most animals; the use of DDT was banned in the US in 1972. <br /><strong>Defoliants</strong> - chemicals which cause plants to lose their leaves artificially; often used in agricultural practices for weed control, and may have detrimental impacts on human and ecosystem health. <br /><strong>Deforestation</strong> - the destruction of vast areas of forest (e.g., unsustainable forestry practices, agricultural and range land clearing, and the over exploitation of wood products for use as fuel) without planting new growth. <br /><strong>Desertification</strong> - the spread of desert-like conditions in arid or semi-arid areas, due to overgrazing, loss of agriculturally productive soils, or climate change. <br /><strong>Dredging</strong> - the practice of deepening an existing waterway; also, a technique used for collecting bottom-dwelling marine organisms (e.g., shellfish) or harvesting coral, often causing significant destruction of reef and ocean-floor ecosystems. <br /><strong>Drift-net fishing</strong> - done with a net, miles in extent, that is generally anchored to a boat and left to float with the tide; often results in an over harvesting and waste of large populations of non-commercial marine species (by-catch) by its effect of \"sweeping the ocean clean.\" <br /><strong>Ecosystems</strong> - ecological units comprised of complex communities of organisms and their specific environments. <br /><strong>Effluent</strong>s - waste materials, such as smoke, sewage, or industrial waste which are released into the environment, subsequently polluting it. <br /><strong>Endangered species</strong> - a species that is threatened with extinction either by direct hunting or habitat destruction. <br /><strong>Freshwater</strong> - water with very low soluble mineral content; sources include lakes, streams, rivers, glaciers, and underground aquifers. <br /><strong>Greenhouse gas</strong> - a gas that \"traps\" infrared radiation in the lower atmosphere causing surface warming; water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. <br /><strong>Groundwater</strong> - water sources found below the surface of the earth often in naturally occurring reservoirs in permeable rock strata; the source for wells and natural springs. <br /><strong>Highlands Water Project</strong> - a series of dams constructed jointly by Lesotho and South Africa to redirect Lesotho's abundant water supply into a rapidly growing area in South Africa; while it is the largest infrastructure project in southern Africa, it is also the most costly and controversial; objections to the project include claims that it forces people from their homes, submerges farmlands, and squanders economic resources. <br /><strong>Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC)</strong> - represents the roughly 150,000 Inuits of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia in international environmental issues; a General Assembly convenes every three years to determine the focus of the ICC; the most current concerns are long-range transport of pollutants, sustainable development, and climate change. <br /><strong>Metallurgical plants</strong> - industries which specialize in the science, technology, and processing of metals; these plants produce highly concentrated and toxic wastes which can contribute to pollution of ground water and air when not properly disposed. <br /><strong>Noxious substances</strong> - injurious, very harmful to living beings. <br /><strong>Overgrazing</strong> - the grazing of animals on plant material faster than it can naturally regrow leading to the permanent loss of plant cover, a common effect of too many animals grazing limited range land. <br /><strong>Ozone shield</strong> - a layer of the atmosphere composed of ozone gas (O3) that resides approximately 25 miles above the Earth's surface and absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation that can be harmful to living organisms. <br /><strong>Poaching</strong> - the illegal killing of animals or fish, a great concern with respect to endangered or threatened species. <br /><strong>Pollution</strong> - the contamination of a healthy environment by man-made waste. <br /><strong>Potable water</strong> - water that is drinkable, safe to be consumed. <br /><strong>Salination</strong> - the process through which fresh (drinkable) water becomes salt (undrinkable) water; hence, desalination is the reverse process; also involves the accumulation of salts in topsoil caused by evaporation of excessive irrigation water, a process that can eventually render soil incapable of supporting crops. <br /><strong>Siltation</strong> - occurs when water channels and reservoirs become clotted with silt and mud, a side effect of deforestation and soil erosion. <br /><strong>Slash-and-burn agriculture</strong> - a rotating cultivation technique in which trees are cut down and burned in order to clear land for temporary agriculture; the land is used until its productivity declines at which point a new plot is selected and the process repeats; this practice is sustainable while population levels are low and time is permitted for regrowth of natural vegetation; conversely, where these conditions do not exist, the practice can have disastrous consequences for the environment. <br /><strong>Soil degradation</strong> - damage to the land's productive capacity because of poor agricultural practices such as the excessive use of pesticides or fertilizers, soil compaction from heavy equipment, or erosion of topsoil, eventually resulting in reduced ability to produce agricultural products. <br /><strong>Soil erosion</strong> - the removal of soil by the action of water or wind, compounded by poor agricultural practices, deforestation, overgrazing, and desertification. <br /><strong>Ultraviolet (UV) radiation</strong> - a portion of the electromagnetic energy emitted by the sun and naturally filtered in the upper atmosphere by the ozone layer; UV radiation can be harmful to living organisms and has been linked to increasing rates of skin cancer in humans. <br /><strong>Waterborne diseases</strong> - those in which bacteria survive in, and are transmitted through, water; always a serious threat in areas with an untreated water supply.","id":"environment-current-issues","content":"air pollution; water pollution from industrial emissions, raw sewage; contamination of drinking water supplies;

Definitions of the major governmental terms are as follows. (Note that for some countries more than one definition applies.):\n\n<br><b>Absolute monarchy</b> - a form of government where the monarch rules unhindered, i.e., without any laws, constitution, or legally organized opposition.\n\n<br><b>Anarchy</b> - a condition of lawlessness or political disorder brought about by the absence of governmental authority. \n\n<br><b>Authoritarian</b> - a form of government in which state authority is imposed onto many aspects of citizens' lives.\n\n<br><b>Commonwealth</b> - a nation, state, or other political entity founded on law and united by a compact of the people for the common good. \n\n<br><b>Communist</b> - a system of government in which the state plans and controls the economy and a single - often authoritarian - party holds power; state controls are imposed with the elimination of private ownership of property or capital while claiming to make progress toward a higher social order in which all goods are equally shared by the people (i.e., a classless society). \n\n<br><b>Confederacy (Confederation)</b> - a union by compact or treaty between states, provinces, or territories, that creates a central government with limited powers; the constituent entities retain supreme authority over all matters except those delegated to the central government. \n\n<br><b>Constitutional</b> - a government by or operating under an authoritative document (constitution) that sets forth the system of fundamental laws and principles that determines the nature, functions, and limits of that government. \n\n<br><b>Constitutional democracy</b> - a form of government in which the sovereign power of the people is spelled out in a governing constitution. \n\n<br><b>Constitutional monarchy</b> - a system of government in which a monarch is guided by a constitution whereby his/her rights, duties, and responsibilities are spelled out in written law or by custom. \n\n<br><b>Democracy</b> - a form of government in which the supreme power is retained by the people, but which is usually exercised indirectly through a system of representation and delegated authority periodically renewed. \n\n<br><b>Democratic republic</b> - a state in which the supreme power rests in the body of citizens entitled to vote for officers and representatives responsible to them. \n\n<br><b>Dictatorship</b> - a form of government in which a ruler or small clique wield absolute power (not restricted by a constitution or laws). \n\n<br><b>Ecclesiastical</b> - a government administrated by a church.\n\n<br><b>Emirate</b> - similar to a monarchy or sultanate, but a government in which the supreme power is in the hands of an emir (the ruler of a Muslim state); the emir may be an absolute overlord or a sovereign with constitutionally limited authority. \n\n<br><b>Federal (Federation)</b> - a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided - usually by means of a constitution - between a central authority and a number of constituent regions (states, colonies, or provinces) so that each region retains some management of its internal affairs; differs from a confederacy in that the central government exerts influence directly upon both individuals as well as upon the regional units. \n\n<br><b>Federal republic</b> - a state in which the powers of the central government are restricted and in which the component parts (states, colonies, or provinces) retain a degree of self-government; ultimate sovereign power rests with the voters who chose their governmental representatives.\n\n<br><b>Islamic republic</b> - a particular form of government adopted by some Muslim states; although such a state is, in theory, a theocracy, it remains a republic, but its laws are required to be compatible with the laws of Islam. \n\n<br><b>Maoism</b> - the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism developed in China by Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung), which states that a continuous revolution is necessary if the leaders of a communist state are to keep in touch with the people. \n\n<br><b>Marxism</b> - the political, economic, and social principles espoused by 19th century economist Karl Marx; he viewed the struggle of workers as a progression of historical forces that would proceed from a class struggle of the proletariat (workers) exploited by capitalists (business owners), to a socialist\"dictatorship of the proletariat,\" to, finally, a classless society - Communism. \n\n<br><b>Marxism-Leninism</b> - an expanded form of communism developed by Lenin from doctrines of Karl Marx; Lenin saw imperialism as the final stage of capitalism and shifted the focus of workers' struggle from developed to underdeveloped countries. \n\n<br><b>Monarchy</b> - a government in which the supreme power is lodged in the hands of a monarch who reigns over a state or territory, usually for life and by hereditary right; the monarch may be either a sole absolute ruler or a sovereign - such as a king, queen, or prince - with constitutionally limited authority. \n\n<br><b>Oligarchy</b> - a government in which control is exercised by a small group of individuals whose authority generally is based on wealth or power. \n\n<br><b>Parliamentary democracy</b> - a political system in which the legislature (parliament) selects the government - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor along with the cabinet ministers - according to party strength as expressed in elections; by this system, the government acquires a dual responsibility: to the people as well as to the parliament. \n\n<br><b>Parliamentary government (Cabinet-Parliamentary government)</b> - a government in which members of an executive branch (the cabinet and its leader - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor) are nominated to their positions by a legislature or parliament, and are directly responsible to it; this type of government can be dissolved at will by the parliament (legislature) by means of a no confidence vote or the leader of the cabinet may dissolve the parliament if it can no longer function. \n\n<br><b>Parliamentary monarchy</b> - a state headed by a monarch who is not actively involved in policy formation or implementation (i.e., the exercise of sovereign powers by a monarch in a ceremonial capacity); true governmental leadership is carried out by a cabinet and its head - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor - who are drawn from a legislature (parliament). \n\n<br><b>Presidential</b> - a system of government where the executive branch exists separately from a legislature (to which it is generally not accountable). \n\n<br><b>Republic</b> - a representative democracy in which the people's elected deputies (representatives), not the people themselves, vote on legislation.\n\n<br><b>Socialism</b> - a government in which the means of planning, producing, and distributing goods is controlled by a central government that theoretically seeks a more just and equitable distribution of property and labor; in actuality, most socialist governments have ended up being no more than dictatorships over workers by a ruling elite. \n\n<br><b>Sultanate</b> - similar to a monarchy, but a government in which the supreme power is in the hands of a sultan (the head of a Muslim state); the sultan may be an absolute ruler or a sovereign with constitutionally limited authority. \n\n<br><b>Theocracy</b> - a form of government in which a Deity is recognized as the supreme civil ruler, but the Deity's laws are interpreted by ecclesiastical authorities (bishops, mullahs, etc.); a government subject to religious authority.\n\n<br><b>Totalitarian</b> - a government that seeks to subordinate the individual to the state by controlling not only all political and economic matters, but also the attitudes, values, and beliefs of its population.","id":"government-type","content":"semi-presidential republic"},{"title":"Capital","comparative":false,"subfields_raw":"name, geographic coordinates, time difference, daylight saving time, time zone note, etymology","field_id":"301","definition":"This entry gives the <em>name</em> of the seat of government, its <em>geographic coordinates</em>, the <em>time difference</em> relative to <strong>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</strong> and the time observed in Washington, DC, and, if applicable, information on <em>daylight saving time</em> <strong>(DST)</strong>.

A statement on judicial review of legislative acts is also included for a number of countries. The legal systems of nearly all countries are generally modeled upon elements of five main types: civil law (including French law, the Napoleonic Code, Roman law, Roman-Dutch law, and Spanish law); common law (including United State law); customary law; mixed or pluralistic law; and religious law (including Islamic law). An additional type of legal system - international law, which governs the conduct of independent nations in their relationships with one another - is also addressed below. The following list describes these legal systems, the countries or world regions where these systems are enforced, and a brief statement on the origins and major features of each. <br /><strong>Civil Law</strong> - The most widespread type of legal system in the world, applied in various forms in approximately 150 countries. Also referred to as European continental law, the civil law system is derived mainly from the Roman <em>Corpus Juris Civilus</em>, (Body of Civil Law), a collection of laws and legal interpretations compiled under the East Roman (Byzantine) Emperor Justinian I between A.D. 528 and 565. The major feature of civil law systems is that the laws are organized into systematic written codes. In civil law the sources recognized as authoritative are principally legislation - especially codifications in constitutions or statutes enacted by governments - and secondarily, custom. The civil law systems in some countries are based on more than one code. <br /><strong>Common Law</strong> - A type of legal system, often synonymous with \"English common law,\" which is the system of England and Wales in the UK, and is also in force in approximately 80 countries formerly part of or influenced by the former British Empire. English common law reflects Biblical influences as well as remnants of law systems imposed by early conquerors including the Romans, Anglo-Saxons, and Normans. Some legal scholars attribute the formation of the English common law system to King Henry II (r.1154-1189). Until the time of his reign, laws customary among England's various manorial and ecclesiastical (church) jurisdictions were administered locally. Henry II established the king's court and designated that laws were \"common\" to the entire English realm. The foundation of English common law is \"legal precedent\" - referred to as <em>stare decisis</em>, meaning \"to stand by things decided.\" In the English common law system, court judges are bound in their decisions in large part by the rules and other doctrines developed - and supplemented over time - by the judges of earlier English courts. <br /><strong>Customary Law</strong> - A type of legal system that serves as the basis of, or has influenced, the present-day laws in approximately 40 countries - mostly in Africa, but some in the Pacific islands, Europe, and the Near East. Customary law is also referred to as \"primitive law,\" \"unwritten law,\" \"indigenous law,\" and \"folk law.\" There is no single history of customary law such as that found in Roman civil law, English common law, Islamic law, or the Napoleonic Civil Code. The earliest systems of law in human society were customary, and usually developed in small agrarian and hunter-gatherer communities. As the term implies, customary law is based upon the customs of a community. Common attributes of customary legal systems are that they are seldom written down, they embody an organized set of rules regulating social relations, and they are agreed upon by members of the community. Although such law systems include sanctions for law infractions, resolution tends to be reconciliatory rather than punitive. A number of African states practiced customary law many centuries prior to colonial influences. Following colonization, such laws were written down and incorporated to varying extents into the legal systems imposed by their colonial powers. <br /><strong>European Union Law</strong> - A sub-discipline of international law known as \"supranational law\" in which the rights of sovereign nations are limited in relation to one another. Also referred to as the Law of the European Union or Community Law, it is the unique and complex legal system that operates in tandem with the laws of the 27 member states of the European Union (EU). Similar to federal states, the EU legal system ensures compliance from the member states because of the Union's decentralized political nature. The European Court of Justice (ECJ), established in 1952 by the Treaty of Paris, has been largely responsible for the development of EU law. Fundamental principles of European Union law include: <em>subsidiarity</em> - the notion that issues be handled by the smallest, lowest, or least centralized competent authority; <em>proportionality</em> - the EU may only act to the extent needed to achieve its objectives; <em>conferral</em> - the EU is a union of member states, and all its authorities are voluntarily granted by its members; <em>legal certainty</em> - requires that legal rules be clear and precise; and <em>precautionary principle</em> - a moral and political principle stating that if an action or policy might cause severe or irreversible harm to the public or to the environment, in the absence of a scientific consensus that harm would not ensue, the burden of proof falls on those who would advocate taking the action. <br /><strong>French Law</strong> - A type of civil law that is the legal system of France. The French system also serves as the basis for, or is mixed with, other legal systems in approximately 50 countries, notably in North Africa, the Near East, and the French territories and dependencies. French law is primarily codified or systematic written civil law. Prior to the French Revolution (1789-1799), France had no single national legal system. Laws in the northern areas of present-day France were mostly local customs based on privileges and exemptions granted by kings and feudal lords, while in the southern areas Roman law predominated. The introduction of the Napoleonic Civil Code during the reign of Napoleon I in the first decade of the 19th century brought major reforms to the French legal system, many of which remain part of France's current legal structure, though all have been extensively amended or redrafted to address a modern nation. French law distinguishes between\"public law\" and \"private law.\" Public law relates to government, the French Constitution, public administration, and criminal law. Private law covers issues between private citizens or corporations. The most recent changes to the French legal system - introduced in the 1980s - were the decentralization laws, which transferred authority from centrally appointed government representatives to locally elected representatives of the people. <br /><strong>International Law</strong> - The law of the international community, or the body of customary rules and treaty rules accepted as legally binding by states in their relations with each other. International law differs from other legal systems in that it primarily concerns sovereign political entities. There are three separate disciplines of international law: public international law, which governs the relationship between provinces and international entities and includes treaty law, law of the sea, international criminal law, and international humanitarian law; private international law, which addresses legal jurisdiction; and supranational law - a legal framework wherein countries are bound by regional agreements in which the laws of the member countries are held inapplicable when in conflict with supranational laws. At present the European Union is the only entity under a supranational legal system. The term \"international law\" was coined by Jeremy Bentham in 1780 in his <em>Principles of Morals and Legislation</em>, though laws governing relations between states have been recognized from very early times (many centuries B.C.). Modern international law developed alongside the emergence and growth of the European nation-states beginning in the early 16th century. Other factors that influenced the development of international law included the revival of legal studies, the growth of international trade, and the practice of exchanging emissaries and establishing legations. The sources of International law are set out in Article 38-1 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice within the UN Charter. <br /><strong>Islamic Law</strong> - The most widespread type of religious law, it is the legal system enforced in over 30 countries, particularly in the Near East, but also in Central and South Asia, Africa, and Indonesia. In many countries Islamic law operates in tandem with a civil law system. Islamic law is embodied in the sharia, an Arabic word meaning\"the right path.\" Sharia covers all aspects of public and private life and organizes them into five categories: obligatory, recommended, permitted, disliked, and forbidden. The primary sources of sharia law are the Qur'an, believed by Muslims to be the word of God revealed to the Prophet Muhammad by the angel Gabriel, and the Sunnah, the teachings of the Prophet and his works. In addition to these two primary sources, traditional Sunni Muslims recognize the consensus of Muhammad's companions and Islamic jurists on certain issues, called ijmas, and various forms of reasoning, including analogy by legal scholars, referred to as qiyas. Shia Muslims reject ijmas and qiyas as sources of sharia law. <br /><strong>Mixed Law</strong> - Also referred to as pluralistic law, mixed law consists of elements of some or all of the other main types of legal systems - civil, common, customary, and religious. The mixed legal systems of a number of countries came about when colonial powers overlaid their own legal systems upon colonized regions but retained elements of the colonies' existing legal systems. <br /><strong>Napoleonic Civil Code</strong> - A type of civil law, referred to as the Civil Code or <em>Code Civil des Francais</em>, forms part of the legal system of France, and underpins the legal systems of Bolivia, Egypt, Lebanon, Poland, and the US state of Louisiana. The Civil Code was established under Napoleon I, enacted in 1804, and officially designated the <em>Code Napoleon</em> in 1807. This legal system combined the Teutonic civil law tradition of the northern provinces of France with the Roman law tradition of the southern and eastern regions of the country. The Civil Code bears similarities in its arrangement to the Roman <em>Body of Civil Law</em> (see Civil Law above). As enacted in 1804, the Code addressed personal status, property, and the acquisition of property. Codes added over the following six years included civil procedures, commercial law, criminal law and procedures, and a penal code. <br /><strong>Religious Law</strong> - A legal system which stems from the sacred texts of religious traditions and in most cases professes to cover all aspects of life as a seamless part of devotional obligations to a transcendent, imminent, or deep philosophical reality. Implied as the basis of religious law is the concept of unalterability, because the word of God cannot be amended or legislated against by judges or governments. However, a detailed legal system generally requires human elaboration. The main types of religious law are sharia in Islam, halakha in Judaism, and canon law in some Christian groups. Sharia is the most widespread religious legal system (see Islamic Law), and is the sole system of law for countries including Iran, the Maldives, and Saudi Arabia. No country is fully governed by halakha, but Jewish people may decide to settle disputes through Jewish courts and be bound by their rulings. Canon law is not a divine law as such because it is not found in revelation. It is viewed instead as human law inspired by the word of God and applying the demands of that revelation to the actual situation of the church. Canon law regulates the internal ordering of the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Anglican Communion. <br /><strong>Roman Law</strong> - A type of civil law developed in ancient Rome and practiced from the time of the city's founding (traditionally 753 B.C.) until the fall of the Western Empire in the 5th century A.D. Roman law remained the legal system of the Byzantine (Eastern Empire) until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Preserved fragments of the first legal text, known as the Law of the Twelve Tables, dating from the 5th century B.C., contained specific provisions designed to change the prevailing customary law. Early Roman law was drawn from custom and statutes; later, during the time of the empire, emperors asserted their authority as the ultimate source of law. The basis for Roman laws was the idea that the exact form - not the intention - of words or of actions produced legal consequences. It was only in the late 6th century A.D. that a comprehensive Roman code of laws was published (see Civil Law above). Roman law served as the basis of law systems developed in a number of continental European countries. <br /><strong>Roman-Dutch Law</strong> - A type of civil law based on Roman law as applied in the Netherlands. Roman-Dutch law serves as the basis for legal systems in seven African countries, as well as Guyana, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. This law system, which originated in the province of Holland and expanded throughout the Netherlands (to be replaced by the French Civil Code in 1809), was instituted in a number of sub-Saharan African countries during the Dutch colonial period. The Dutch jurist/philosopher Hugo Grotius was the first to attempt to reduce Roman-Dutch civil law into a system in his <em>Jurisprudence of Holland</em> (written 1619-20, commentary published 1621). The Dutch historian/lawyer Simon van Leeuwen coined the term \"Roman-Dutch law\" in 1652. <br /><strong>Spanish Law</strong> - A type of civil law, often referred to as the Spanish Civil Code, it is the present legal system of Spain and is the basis of legal systems in 12 countries mostly in Central and South America, but also in southwestern Europe, northern and western Africa, and southeastern Asia. The Spanish Civil Code reflects a complex mixture of customary, Roman, Napoleonic, local, and modern codified law. The laws of the Visigoth invaders of Spain in the 5th to 7th centuries had the earliest major influence on Spanish legal system development. The Christian Reconquest of Spain in the 11th through 15th centuries witnessed the development of customary law, which combined canon (religious) and Roman law. During several centuries of Hapsburg and Bourbon rule, systematic recompilations of the existing national legal system were attempted, but these often conflicted with local and regional customary civil laws. Legal system development for most of the 19th century concentrated on formulating a national civil law system, which was finally enacted in 1889 as the Spanish Civil Code. Several sections of the code have been revised, the most recent of which are the penal code in 1989 and the judiciary code in 2001. The Spanish Civil Code separates public and private law. Public law includes constitutional law, administrative law, criminal law, process law, financial and tax law, and international public law. Private law includes civil law, commercial law, labor law, and international private law. <br /><strong>United States Law</strong> - A type of common law, which is the basis of the legal system of the United States and that of its island possessions in the Caribbean and the Pacific. This legal system has several layers, more possibly than in most other countries, and is due in part to the division between federal and state law. The United States was founded not as one nation but as a union of 13 colonies, each claiming independence from the British Crown. The US Constitution, implemented in 1789, began shifting power away from the states and toward the federal government, though the states today retain substantial legal authority. US law draws its authority from four sources: <em>constitutional law</em>, <em>statutory law</em>, <em>administrative regulations</em>, and <em>case law</em>. Constitutional law is based on the US Constitution and serves as the supreme federal law. Taken together with those of the state constitutions, these documents outline the general structure of the federal and state governments and provide the rules and limits of power. US statutory law is legislation enacted by the US Congress and is codified in the United States Code. The 50 state legislatures have similar authority to enact state statutes. Administrative law is the authority delegated to federal and state executive agencies. Case law, also referred to as common law, covers areas where constitutional or statutory law is lacking. Case law is a collection of judicial decisions, customs, and general principles that began in England centuries ago, that were adopted in America at the time of the Revolution, and that continue to develop today.","id":"legal-system","content":"civil law system"},{"title":"International law organization participation","comparative":false,"field_id":"309","definition":"This entry includes information on a country's acceptance of jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and of the International Criminal Court (ICCt); 61 countries have accepted ICJ jurisdiction with reservations and 12 have accepted ICJ jurisdiction without reservations; 123 countries and the Palestine Liberation Organization have accepted ICCt jurisdiction. <a href=\"/the-world-factbook/references/international-organizations-and-groups/\">Appendix B: International Organizations and Groups</a> explains the differing mandates of the ICJ and ICCt.","id":"international-law-organization-participation","content":"has not submitted an ICJ jurisdiction declaration; non-party state to the ICCt"},{"title":"Citizenship","comparative":false,"subfields_raw":"citizenship by birth, citizenship by descent only, dual citizenship recognized, residency requirement for naturalization","field_id":"310","definition":"This entry provides information related to the acquisition and exercise of citizenship; it includes four subfields:<br /><br /> <em>citizenship by birth</em> describes the acquisition of citizenship based on place of birth, known as <em>Jus soli</em>, regardless of the citizenship of parents.<br /><br /> <em>citizenship by descent only</em> describes the acquisition of citizenship based on the principle of <em>Jus sanguinis</em>, or by descent, where at least one parent is a citizen of the state and being born within the territorial limits of the state is not required.

In some cases, citizenship is conferred through the father or mother exclusively.<br /><br /> <em>dual citizenship recognized</em> indicates whether a state permits a citizen to simultaneously hold citizenship in another state. Many states do not permit dual citizenship and the voluntary acquisition of citizenship in another country is grounds for revocation of citizenship. Holding dual citizenship makes an individual legally obligated to more than one state and can negate the normal consular protections afforded to citizens outside their original country of citizenship.<br /><br /> <em>residency requirement for naturalization</em> lists the length of time an applicant is required to live in a state before applying for naturalization. In most countries citizenship can be acquired through the legal process of naturalization.

The elections subfield includes the dates of the last election and next election. The <em>election results</em> subfield lists <em>percent of vote by party/coalition</em> and <em>number of seats by party/coalition</em> in the last election (in bicameral legislatures, upper house results are listed first). In general, parties with less than four seats and less than 4 percent of the vote are aggregated and listed as \"other,\" and non-party-affiliated seats are listed as \"independent.\" Also, the entries for some countries include two sets of <em>percent of vote by party</em> and <em>seats by party</em>; the former reflects results following a formal election announcement, and the latter – following a mid-term or byelection – reflects changes in a legislature’s political party composition.<br><br>\nOf the approximately 240 countries with legislative bodies, approximately two-thirds are unicameral, and the remainder, bicameral. The selection of legislative members is typically governed by a country's constitution and/or its electoral laws. In general, members are either directly elected by a country's eligible voters using a defined electoral system; indirectly elected or selected by its province, state, or department legislatures; or appointed by the country's executive body. Legislative members in many countries are selected both directly and indirectly, and the electoral laws of some countries reserve seats for women and various ethnic and minority groups.<br><br> \nWorldwide, the two predominant direct voting systems are plurality/majority and proportional representation. The most common of the several plurality/majority systems is simple majority vote, or first-past-the-post, in which the candidate receiving the most votes is elected. Countries' legislatures such as Bangladesh's Parliament, Malaysia's House of Representatives, and the United Kingdom's House of Commons use this system. Another common plurality/majority system – absolute majority or two-round – requires that candidates win at least 50 percent of the votes to be elected. If none of the candidates meets that vote threshold in the initial election, a second poll or\"runoff\" is held soon after for the two top vote getters, and the candidate receiving a simple vote majority is declared the winner. Examples of the two-round system are Haiti's Chamber of Deputies, Mali's National Assembly, and Uzbekistan's Legislative Chamber. Other plurality/majority voting systems, referred to as preferential voting and generally used in multi-seat constituencies, are block vote and single non-transferable vote, in which voters cast their ballots by ranking their candidate preferences from highest to lowest.<br><br>\nProportional representation electoral systems – in contrast to plurality/majority systems – generally award legislative seats to political parties in approximate proportion to the number of votes each receives. For example, in a 100-member legislature, if Party A receives 50 percent of the total vote, Party B, 30 percent, and Party C, 20 percent, then Party A would be awarded 50 seats, Party B 30 seats, and Party C 20 seats. There are various forms of proportional representation and the degree of reaching proportionality varies. Some forms of proportional representation are focused solely on achieving the proportional representation of different political parties and voters cast ballots only for political parties, whereas in other forms, voters cast ballots for individual candidates within a political party.<br><br>\nMany countries - both unicameral and bicameral - use a mix of electoral methods, in which a portion of legislative seats are awarded using one system, such as plurality/majority, while the remaining seats are awarded by another system, such as proportional representation. Many countries with bicameral legislatures use different voting systems for the two chambers.","id":"legislative-branch","content":"<strong>description: </strong>unicameral Legislative Yuan (113 seats; 73 members directly elected in single-seat constituencies by simple majority vote, 34 directly elected in a single island-wide constituency by proportional representation vote, and 6 directly elected in multi-seat aboriginal constituencies by proportional representation vote; members serve 4-year terms)<br><br><strong>elections: </strong>last held on 11 January 2020 (next to be held on 11 January 2024)<br><br><strong>election results: </strong>percent of vote by party - Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) 34.0%, Kuomintang (KMT) 33.4%, Taiwan People's Party (TPP) 11.2%, New Power Party (NPP) 7.5%; seats by party - DPP 61, KMT 38, TPP 5, NPP 3"},{"title":"Judicial branch","comparative":false,"subfields_raw":"highest courts, judge selection and term of office, subordinate courts","field_id":"314","definition":"This entry includes three subfields.

However, follow-on components of the ECFA, including a signed agreement on trade in services and negotiations on trade in goods and dispute resolution, have stalled. In early 2014, the government bowed to public demand and proposed a new law governing the oversight of cross-Strait agreements, before any additional deals with China are implemented; the legislature has yet to vote on such legislation, leaving the future of ECFA uncertain. President TSAI since taking office in May 2016 has promoted greater economic integration with South and Southeast Asia through the New Southbound Policy initiative and has also expressed interest in Taiwan joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership as well as bilateral trade deals with partners such as the US.

Taiwan since 2009 has gradually loosened rules governing Chinese investment and has also secured greater market access for its investors on the mainland. In August 2012, the Taiwan Central Bank signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on cross-Strait currency settlement with its Chinese counterpart.

The measure is difficult to compute, as a US dollar value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent in the United States (for example, the value of an ox-cart or non-US military equipment); as a result, PPP estimates for some countries are based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services. In addition, many countries do not formally participate in the World Bank's PPP project that calculates these measures, so the resulting GDP estimates for these countries may lack precision. For many developing countries, PPP-based GDP measures are multiples of the official exchange rate (OER) measure. The differences between the OER- and PPP-denominated GDP values for most of the wealthy industrialized countries are generally much smaller.","id":"real-gdp-purchasing-power-parity","content":"$1,143,277,000,000 (2019 est.)<br><br>$1,113,126,000,000 (2018 est.)<br><br>$1,083,384,000,000 (2017 est.)<br><br><strong>note:</strong> data are in 2010 dollars"},{"title":"Real GDP growth rate","comparative":"104","field_id":"210","definition":"This entry gives a country's real GDP annual growth rate, adjusted for seasonal unemployment and inflation.

A nation's GDP at official exchange rates (OER) is the home-currency-denominated annual GDP figure divided by the bilateral average US exchange rate with that country in that year. The measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output. Many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-à-vis its neighbors, judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace. Official exchange rates, however, can be artificially fixed and/or subject to manipulation - resulting in claims of the country having an under- or over-valued currency - and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate. Moreover, even if the official exchange rate is market-determined, market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services (the ones the country trades) and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces. Furthermore, OER-converted GDP is not well suited to comparing domestic GDP over time, since appreciation/depreciation from one year to the next will make the OER GDP value rise/fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated GDP changed.","id":"gdp-official-exchange-rate","content":"$611.391 billion (2019 est.)"},{"title":"Inflation rate (consumer prices)","comparative":"45","field_id":"229","definition":"This entry provides the annual inflation rate, as calculated by the percent change in current consumer prices from the previous year's consumer prices.","id":"inflation-rate-consumer-prices","content":"0.5% (2019 est.)<br><br>1.3% (2018 est.)<br><br>0.6% (2017 est.)"},{"title":"Credit ratings","comparative":false,"subfields_raw":"Fitch rating, Moody's rating, Standard & Poors rating","field_id":"237","definition":"This entry provides the current bond ratings for a country or territory from each of the three major credit bureaus (Fitch, Moody&rsquo;s, and Standard &amp; Poors).

This includes consumption of both domestically produced and foreign goods and services. <br /><br /><em>government consumption</em> consists of government expenditures on goods and services. These figures exclude government transfer payments, such as interest on debt, unemployment, and social security, since such payments are not made in exchange for goods and services supplied. <br /><br /><em>investment in fixed capital</em> consists of total business spending on fixed assets, such as factories, machinery, equipment, dwellings, and inventories of raw materials, which provide the basis for future production. It is measured gross of the depreciation of the assets, i.e., it includes investment that merely replaces worn-out or scrapped capital. Earlier editions of <em>The World Factbook</em> referred to this concept as Investment (gross fixed) and that data now have been moved to this new field.<br /><br /><em>investment in inventories</em> consists of net changes to the stock of outputs that are still held by the units that produce them, awaiting further sale to an end user, such as automobiles sitting on a dealer&rsquo;s lot or groceries on the store shelves. This figure may be positive or negative. If the stock of unsold output increases during the relevant time period, <em>investment in inventories</em> is positive, but, if the stock of unsold goods declines, it will be negative. <em>Investment in inventories</em> normally is an early indicator of the state of the economy. If the stock of unsold items increases unexpectedly &ndash; because people stop buying - the economy may be entering a recession; but if the stock of unsold items falls - and goods \"go flying off the shelves\" - businesses normally try to replace those stocks, and the economy is likely to accelerate.<br /><br /><em>exports of goods and services</em> consist of sales, barter, gifts, or grants of goods and services from residents to nonresidents.<br /><br /><em>imports of goods and services</em> consist of purchases, barter, or receipts of gifts, or grants of goods and services by residents from nonresidents. <em>Exports</em> are treated as a positive item, while imports are treated as a negative item. In a purely accounting sense, <em>imports</em> have no direct impact on GDP, which only measures output of the domestic economy. Imports are entered as a negative item to offset the fact that the expenditure figures for consumption, investment, government, and exports also include expenditures on imports. These imports contribute directly to foreign GDP but only indirectly to domestic GDP. Because of this negative offset for imports of goods and services, the sum of the other five items, excluding imports, will always total more than 100 percent of GDP.

Applications, include enhanced mobile web access, IP telephony, high-definition mobile TV, and video conferencing.<br /><strong>5G -</strong>&nbsp;is the fifth generation technology standard for cellular networks, which&nbsp;cellular phone companies&nbsp;began deploying worldwide in 2019; it is the planned successor to the&nbsp;4G&nbsp;networks which provide connectivity to most current&nbsp;cellphones.&nbsp;Like its predecessors, 5G networks are&nbsp;cellular networks, in which the service area is divided into small geographical areas called&nbsp;cells. All 5G wireless devices in a cell are connected to the&nbsp;Internet&nbsp;and&nbsp;telephone network&nbsp;by&nbsp;radio waves&nbsp;through a local&nbsp;antenna&nbsp;in the cell. The main advantage of the new networks is that they will have greater bandwidth, allowing higher download speeds, eventually up to 10 gigabits per second (Gbit/s). Due to the increased bandwidth, the expectation is that the new networks will not just serve cellphones like existing cellular networks, but also be used as general Internet service providers for laptops and desktop computers, competing with existing ISPs such as&nbsp;cable Internet. Existing 4G cellphones will not be able to use the new networks, which will require new 5G-enabled wireless devices.<br /><strong>ADSL -</strong> Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) is a type of digital subscriber line (DSL) that allows faster data transmission via copper service phone lines to a home or business. ADSL provides an &ldquo;always on&rdquo; connection and higher speeds than dial-up Internet can provide. In ADSL, bandwidth and bit rate (i.e., speed) are asymmetric, meaning greater toward the customer (downstream) than the reverse (upstream).<br /><strong>AngoSat 2</strong> - geostationary communications satellite for ground communication and broadcasting infrastructure in Angola, operated by Angosat and built by the Russian company ISS Reshetnev.<br /><strong>Arabsat</strong> - Arab Satellite Communications Organization (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia). <br /><strong>Cellular telephone system</strong> - the telephones in this system are radio transceivers, with each instrument having its own private radio frequency and sufficient radiated power to reach the booster station in its area (cell), from which the telephone signal is fed to a telephone exchange. <br /><strong>Central American Microwave System</strong> - a trunk microwave radio relay system that links the countries of Central America and Mexico with each other. <br /><strong>Coaxial cable</strong> - a multichannel communication cable consisting of a central conducting wire, surrounded by and insulated from a cylindrical conducting shell; a large number of telephone channels can be made available within the insulated space by the use of a large number of carrier frequencies. <br /><strong>DSL - </strong>Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) is a family of technologies that are used to transmit digital data over telephone lines.<br /><strong>e-services</strong> - Electronic services rely on information and communication technologies (ICT); the three main components of e-services are the service provider, service receiver (or customer), and the channel for delivery, generally the Internet.

As fiber optic cables are able to carry much more data than copper cables, especially over long distances, copper telephone networks built in the 20th century are being replaced by fiber. FTTX is a general term for several configurations of fiber deployment, broadly organized into two groups: FTTN and FTTP /H/B. Fiber to the node (FTTN), also referred to as Fiber to the neighborhood, delivers fiber to within 300m (1,000 ft) of a customer&rsquo;s premises. Fiber to the premises (FTTP) can be further categorized as fiber to the home (FTTH) or fiber to the building/business (FTTB).

These categories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally produced and sold outside of medical channels. <br /><strong>Cannabis</strong> (<em>Cannabis sativa</em>) is the common hemp plant, which provides hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana (pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil). <br /><strong>Coca</strong> (mostly <em>Erythroxylum coca</em>) is a bush with leaves that contain the stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa, which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter. <br /><strong>Cocaine</strong> is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush. <br /><strong>Depressants</strong> (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal, phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone (Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl, Valmid). <br /><strong>Drugs</strong> are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral change in an individual. <br /><strong>Drug abuse</strong> is the excessive use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that results in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an individual. <br /><strong>Hallucinogens</strong> are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog), phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin, psilocyn). <br /><strong>Hashish</strong> is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant (<em>Cannabis sativa</em>). <br /><strong>Heroin</strong> is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine. <br /><strong>Mandrax</strong> is a trade name for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical depressant. <br /><strong>Marijuana</strong> is the dried leaf of the cannabis or hemp plant (<em>Cannabis sativa</em>). <br /><strong>Methaqualone</strong> is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as mandrax in Southwest Asia and Africa. <br /><strong>Narcotics</strong> are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with codeine, Robitussin AC), and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic narcotics include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon, Lomotil). <br /><strong>Opium</strong> is the brown, gummy exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the opium poppy. <br /><strong>Opium poppy</strong> (<em>Papaver somniferum</em>) is the source for the natural and semisynthetic narcotics. <br /><strong>Poppy straw</strong> is the entire cut and dried opium poppy-plant material, other than the seeds. Opium is extracted from poppy straw in commercial operations that produce the drug for medical use. <br /><strong>Qat </strong>(kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of <em>Catha edulis</em> that is chewed or drunk as tea. <br /><strong>Quaaludes</strong> is the North American slang term for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical depressant. <br /><strong>Stimulants</strong> are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines (Desoxyn, Dexedrine), ephedrine, ecstasy (clarity, essence, doctor, Adam), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others (Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).","id":"illicit-drugs","content":"<p>major source of precursor chemicals used in the production of illicit narcotics</p>"}],"comparative":false}]}
