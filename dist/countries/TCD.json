This view features one of the largest of a series of ten, mostly fresh water lakes in the Ounianga basin in the heart of the Sahara Desert. The lakes are the remnant of a single large lake - probably tens of kilometers long - that once occupied this remote area approximately 14,800 to 5,500 years ago. As the climate dried out during the subsequent millennia, the lake was reduced in size and large wind-driven sand dunes invaded the original depression dividing it into several smaller basins. The area shown in this image measures approximately 11 x 9 km, with the dark water surfaces of the lake segregated almost completely by orange linear sand dunes that stream into the depression from the northeast. The almost year-round northeast winds and cloudless skies make for very high evaporation (an evaporation rate of greater than 6 m per year has been measured in one of the nearby lakes). Nonetheless, only one of the ten lakes is saline because a very large aquifer reaches the surface in the Ounianga depression in the form of the lakes. The aquifer is large enough to keep supplying the small lakes with water despite the high evaporation rate. Mats of floating reeds also reduce the evaporation in places. The lakes form a hydrological system that is unique in the Sahara Desert.

These states focused on controlling trans-Saharan trade routes and profited mostly from the slave trade. The Kanem-Bornu Empire, centered around the Lake Chad Basin, existed between the 9<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries, and during its peak, the empire controlled territory stretching from southern Chad to southern Libya and included portions of modern-day Algeria, Cameroon, Nigeria, Niger, and Sudan. The Sudanese warlord Rabih AZ-ZUBAYR used an army comprised largely of slaves to conquer the Kanem-Bornu Empire in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. In southeastern Chad, the Bagirmi and Ouaddai (Wadai) kingdoms emerged in the 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> centuries and lasted until the arrival of the French in the 19<sup>th </sup>and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. France began moving into the region in the late 1880s and defeated the Bagirmi kingdom in 1897, Rabih AZ-ZUBAYR in 1900, and the Ouddai kingdom in 1909. In the arid regions of northern Chad and southern Libya, an Islamic order called the Sanusiyya (Sanusi) relied heavily on the trans-Saharan slave trade and had upwards of 3 million followers by the 1880s. The French arrived in the region in the early 1900s and defeated the Sanusiyya in 1910 after years of intermittent war. By 1910, France had incorporated the northern arid region, the Lake Chad Basin, and southeastern Chad into French Equatorial Africa. &nbsp;</p> <p>Chad achieved its independence in 1960 and saw three decades of instability, oppressive rule, civil war, and a Libyan invasion. With the help of the French military and several African countries, Chadian leaders expelled Libyan forces during the 1987 \"Toyota War,\" so named for the use of Toyota pickup trucks as fighting vehicles. In 1990, Chadian general Idriss DEBY led a rebellion against President Hissene HABRE. Under DEBY, Chad drafted and approved a constitution and held elections in 1996. DEBY led the country until April 2021 when he was killed during a rebel incursion. Shortly after his death, a group of military officials - led by former President DEBY&rsquo;s son, Mahamat Idriss DEBY - took control of the government. The military officials dismissed the National Assembly, suspended the Constitution, and formed a Transitional Military Council while pledging to hold democratic elections in October 2022.</p> <p>Chad faces widespread poverty, an economy severely weakened by low international oil prices, and rebel and terrorist-led insurgencies in the Lake Chad Basin. Additionally, northern Chad has seen several waves of rebellions since 1998. In late 2015, the government imposed a state of emergency in the Lake Chad Basin following multiple attacks by the terrorist group Boko Haram, now known as ISIS-West Africa. In mid-2015, Boko Haram conducted bombings in N'Djamena. In late 2019, the Chadian government also declared a state of emergency in the Sila and Ouaddai regions bordering Sudan and in the Tibesti region bordering Niger where rival ethnic groups are still fighting. The army has suffered heavy losses to Islamic terror groups in the Lake Chad Basin. In March 2020, Islamic militants attacked a Chadian military camp in the Lake Chad Basin and killed nearly 100 soldiers; it was the deadliest attack in the history of the Chadian military.</p>"}],"comparative":false},{"title":"Geography","fields":[{"title":"Location","comparative":false,"field_id":"276","definition":"This entry identifies the country's regional location, neighboring countries, and adjacent bodies of water.","id":"location","content":"Central Africa, south of Libya"},{"title":"Geographic coordinates","comparative":false,"field_id":"277","definition":"This entry includes rounded latitude and longitude figures for the centroid or center point of a country expressed in degrees and minutes; it is based on the locations provided in the Geographic Names Server (GNS), maintained by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency on behalf of the US Board on Geographic Names.","id":"geographic-coordinates","content":"15 00 N, 19 00 E"},{"title":"Map references","comparative":false,"field_id":"278","definition":"This entry includes the name of the <em>Factbook</em> reference map on which a country may be found.

this sovereignty extends to the air space over the territorial sea as well as its underlying seabed and subsoil; every state has the right to establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not exceeding 12 nautical miles; the normal baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the mean low-water line along the coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the coastal state; where the coasts of two states are opposite or adjacent to each other, neither state is entitled to extend its territorial sea beyond the median line, every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the baseline from which the territorial seas of both states are measured; the UNCLOS describes specific rules for archipelagic states.<br /> <br /><em>contiguous zone</em> - according to the UNCLOS (Article 33), this is a zone contiguous to a coastal state's territorial sea, over which it may exercise the control necessary to: prevent infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory or territorial sea; punish infringement of the above laws and regulations committed within its territory or territorial sea; the contiguous zone may not extend beyond 24 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured (e.g., the US has claimed a 12-nautical mile contiguous zone in addition to its 12-nautical mile territorial sea); where the coasts of two states are opposite or adjacent to each other, neither state is entitled to extend its contiguous zone beyond the median line, every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the baseline from which the contiguous zone of both states are measured.<br /> <br /><em>exclusive economic zone (EEZ)</em> - the UNCLOS (Part V) defines the EEZ as a zone beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea in which a coastal state has: sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources, whether living or non-living, of the waters superjacent to the seabed and of the seabed and its subsoil, and with regard to other activities for the economic exploitation and exploration of the zone, such as the production of energy from the water, currents, and winds; jurisdiction with regard to the establishment and use of artificial islands, installations, and structures; marine scientific research; the protection and preservation of the marine environment; the outer limit of the exclusive economic zone shall not exceed 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.<br /> <br /><em>continental shelf</em> - the UNCLOS (Article 76) defines the continental shelf of a coastal state as comprising the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance; the continental margin comprises the submerged prolongation of the landmass of the coastal state, and consists of the seabed and subsoil of the shelf, the slope and the rise; wherever the continental margin extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baseline, coastal states may extend their claim to a distance not to exceed 350 nautical miles from the baseline or 100 nautical miles from the 2,500-meter isobath, which is a line connecting points of 2,500 meters in depth; it does not include the deep ocean floor with its oceanic ridges or the subsoil thereof.<br /> <br /><em>exclusive fishing zone</em> - while this term is not used in the UNCLOS, some states (e.g., the United Kingdom) have chosen not to claim an EEZ but rather to claim jurisdiction over the living resources off their coast; in such cases, the term exclusive fishing zone is often used; the breadth of this zone is normally the same as the EEZ or 200 nautical miles.","id":"maritime-claims","content":"none (landlocked)"},{"title":"Climate","comparative":false,"field_id":"284","definition":"This entry includes a brief description of typical weather regimes throughout the year;

Its guiding focus is to encourage the unity of all peoples on the earth so that justice and peace may be achieved on earth.

Buddhism focuses on the goal of spiritual enlightenment centered on an understanding of Gautama Buddha's Four Noble Truths on the nature of suffering, and on the Eightfold Path of spiritual and moral practice, to break the cycle of suffering of which we are a part. Buddhism ascribes to a karmic system of rebirth.

Theravadans follow the Pali Canon of Buddha's teachings, and believe that one may escape the cycle of rebirth, worldly attachment, and suffering for oneself; this process may take one or several lifetimes. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahayana Buddhism, including subsets Zen and Tibetan (Lamaistic) Buddhism: Forms of Mahayana Buddhism are common in East Asia and Tibet, and parts of the West. Mahayanas have additional scriptures beyond the Pali Canon and believe the Buddha is eternal and still teaching. Unlike Theravada Buddhism, Mahayana schools maintain the Buddha-nature is present in all beings and all will ultimately achieve enlightenment. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoa Hao: a minority tradition of Buddhism practiced in Vietnam that stresses lay participation, primarily by peasant farmers; it eschews expensive ceremonies and temples and relocates the primary practices into the home.<br /><strong>Christianity</strong> - Descending from Judaism, Christianity's central belief maintains Jesus of Nazareth is the promised messiah of the Hebrew Scriptures, and that his life, death, and resurrection are salvific for the world. Christianity is one of the three monotheistic Abrahamic faiths, along with Islam and Judaism, which traces its spiritual lineage to Abraham of the Hebrew Scriptures. Its sacred texts include the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament (or the Christian Gospels). <br /><em>Basic Groupings</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catholicism (or Roman Catholicism): This is the oldest established western Christian church and the world's largest single religious body. It is supranational, and recognizes a hierarchical structure with the Pope, or Bishop of Rome, as its head, located at the Vatican. Catholics believe the Pope is the divinely ordered head of the Church from a direct spiritual legacy of Jesus' apostle Peter. Catholicism is comprised of 23 particular Churches, or Rites - one Western (Roman or Latin-Rite) and 22 Eastern. The Latin Rite is by far the largest, making up about 98% of Catholic membership. Eastern-Rite Churches, such as the Maronite Church and the Ukrainian Catholic Church, are in communion with Rome although they preserve their own worship traditions and their immediate hierarchy consists of clergy within their own rite. The Catholic Church has a comprehensive theological and moral doctrine specified for believers in its catechism, which makes it unique among most forms of Christianity. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: The Church was organized in 1830 and teaches that it is the restoration of Jesus Christ's original church. It embraces salvation through Christ, personal revelation, and has an open canon, including the King James Bible and the Book of Mormon, which is another testament of Christ's divinity. The Book of Mormon maintains there was an appearance of Jesus in the New World following the Christian account of his resurrection, and that the Americas are uniquely blessed continents. The Church has a centralized doctrine and leadership structure, but has volunteer, lay clergy who oversee local congregations in 176 countries and territories.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jehovah's Witnesses structure their faith on the Christian Bible, but their rejection of the Trinity is distinct from mainstream Christianity. They believe that a Kingdom of God, the Theocracy, will emerge following Armageddon and usher in a new earthly society. Adherents are required to evangelize and to follow a strict moral code.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orthodox Christianity: The oldest established eastern form of Christianity, the Holy Orthodox Church, has a ceremonial head in the Bishop of Constantinople (Istanbul), also known as a Patriarch, but its various regional forms (e.g., Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Serbian Orthodox, Ukrainian Orthodox) are autocephalous (independent of Constantinople's authority, and have their own Patriarchs). Orthodox churches are highly nationalist and ethnic. The Orthodox Christian faith shares many theological tenets with the Roman Catholic Church, but diverges on some key premises and does not recognize the governing authority of the Pope. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protestant Christianity: Protestant Christianity originated in the 16th century as an attempt to reform Roman Catholicism's practices, dogma, and theology. It encompasses several forms or denominations which are extremely varied in structure, beliefs, relationship to national governments, clergy, and governance. Many protestant theologies emphasize the primary role of scripture in their faith, advocating individual interpretation of Christian texts without the mediation of a final religious authority such as the Roman Pope. The oldest Protestant denominations include Lutheranism, Calvinism (Presbyterianism), and Anglican Christianity (Episcopalianism), which have established liturgies, governing structure, and formal clergy. Other variants on Protestant Christianity, including Pentecostal movements and independent churches, may lack one or more of these elements, and their leadership and beliefs are individualized and dynamic. <br /><strong>Hinduism</strong> - Originating in the Vedic civilization of India (second and first millennium B.C.), Hinduism is an extremely diverse set of beliefs and practices with no single founder or religious authority. Hinduism has many scriptures; the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the Bhagavad-Gita are among some of the most important. Hindus may worship one or many deities, usually with prayer rituals within their own home. The most common figures of devotion are the gods Vishnu, Shiva, and a mother goddess, Devi. Most Hindus believe the soul, or <em>atman</em>, is eternal, and goes through a cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (<em>samsara</em>) determined by one's positive or negative karma, or the consequences of one's actions. The goal of religious life is to learn to act so as to finally achieve liberation (<em>moksha</em>) of one's soul, escaping the rebirth cycle. <br /><strong>Islam</strong> - One of the three monotheistic Abrahamic faiths, Islam originated with the teachings of Muhammad in the 7th century. Muslims believe Muhammad is the final of all religious prophets (beginning with Abraham) and that the Qu'ran, which is the Islamic scripture, was revealed to him by God. Islam derives from the word submission, and obedience to God is a primary theme in this religion. In order to live an Islamic life, believers must follow the five pillars, or tenets, of Islam, which are the testimony of faith (<em>shahada</em>), daily prayer (<em>salah</em>), giving alms (<em>zakah</em>), fasting during Ramadan (<em>sawm</em>), and the pilgrimage to Mecca (<em>hajj</em>). <br /><em>Basic Groupings</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two primary branches of Islam are Sunni and Shia, which split from each other over a religio-political leadership dispute about the rightful successor to Muhammad. The Shia believe Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, Ali, was the only divinely ordained Imam (religious leader), while the Sunni maintain the first three caliphs after Muhammad were also legitimate authorities. In modern Islam, Sunnis and Shia continue to have different views of acceptable schools of Islamic jurisprudence, and who is a proper Islamic religious authority. Islam also has an active mystical branch, Sufism, with various Sunni and Shia subsets. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sunni Islam accounts for over 87-90% of the world's Muslim population. It recognizes the Abu Bakr as the first caliph after Muhammad. Sunni has four schools of Islamic doctrine and law - Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali - which uniquely interpret the <em>Hadith</em>, or recorded oral traditions of Muhammad. A Sunni Muslim may elect to follow any one of these schools, as all are considered equally valid. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Shia Islam represents 10-13% of Muslims worldwide, and its distinguishing feature is its reverence for Ali as an infallible, divinely inspired leader, and as the first Imam of the Muslim community after Muhammad. A majority of Shia are known as \"Twelvers,\" because they believe that the 11 familial successor imams after Muhammad culminate in a 12th Imam (al-Mahdi) who is hidden in the world and will reappear at its end to redeem the righteous. <br /><em>Variants</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ismaili faith: A sect of Shia Islam, its adherents are also known as \"Seveners,\" because they believe that the rightful seventh Imam in Islamic leadership was Isma'il, the elder son of Imam Jafar al-Sadiq. Ismaili tradition awaits the return of the seventh Imam as the Mahdi, or Islamic messianic figure. Ismailis are located in various parts of the world, particularly South Asia and the Levant. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alawi faith: Another Shia sect of Islam, the name reflects followers' devotion to the religious authority of Ali. Alawites are a closed, secretive religious group who assert they are Shia Muslims, although outside scholars speculate their beliefs may have a syncretic mix with other faiths originating in the Middle East. Alawis live mostly in Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druze faith: A highly secretive tradition and a closed community that derives from the Ismaili sect of Islam; its core beliefs are thought to emphasize a combination of Gnostic principles believing that the Fatimid caliph, al-Hakin, is the one who embodies the key aspects of goodness of the universe, which are, the intellect, the word, the soul, the preceder, and the follower. The Druze have a key presence in Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. <br /><strong>Jainism</strong> - Originating in India, Jain spiritual philosophy believes in an eternal human soul, the eternal universe, and a principle of \"the own nature of things.\" It emphasizes compassion for all living things, seeks liberation of the human soul from reincarnation through enlightenment, and values personal responsibility due to the belief in the immediate consequences of one's behavior. Jain philosophy teaches non-violence and prescribes vegetarianism for monks and laity alike; its adherents are a highly influential religious minority in Indian society. <br /><strong>Judaism</strong> - One of the first known monotheistic religions, likely dating to between 2000-1500 B.C., Judaism is the native faith of the Jewish people, based upon the belief in a covenant of responsibility between a sole omnipotent creator God and Abraham, the patriarch of Judaism's Hebrew Bible, or <em>Tanakh</em>. Divine revelation of principles and prohibitions in the Hebrew Scriptures form the basis of Jewish law, or <em>halakhah</em>, which is a key component of the faith. While there are extensive traditions of Jewish halakhic and theological discourse, there is no final dogmatic authority in the tradition. Local communities have their own religious leadership. Modern Judaism has three basic categories of faith: Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform/Liberal. These differ in their views and observance of Jewish law, with the Orthodox representing the most traditional practice, and Reform/Liberal communities the most accommodating of individualized interpretations of Jewish identity and faith. <br /><strong>Shintoism</strong> - A native animist tradition of Japan, Shinto practice is based upon the premise that every being and object has its own spirit or <em>kami</em>. Shinto practitioners worship several particular <em>kamis</em>, including the <em>kamis</em> of nature, and families often have shrines to their ancestors' <em>kamis</em>. Shintoism has no fixed tradition of prayers or prescribed dogma, but is characterized by individual ritual. Respect for the <em>kamis</em> in nature is a key Shinto value. Prior to the end of World War II, Shinto was the state religion of Japan, and bolstered the cult of the Japanese emperor. <br /><strong>Sikhism</strong> - Founded by the Guru Nanak (born 1469), Sikhism believes in a non-anthropomorphic, supreme, eternal, creator God; centering one's devotion to God is seen as a means of escaping the cycle of rebirth. Sikhs follow the teachings of Nanak and nine subsequent gurus. Their scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib - also known as the Adi Granth - is considered the living Guru, or final authority of Sikh faith and theology. Sikhism emphasizes equality of humankind and disavows caste, class, or gender discrimination. <br /><strong>Taoism</strong> - Chinese philosophy or religion based upon Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching, which centers on belief in the Tao, or the way, as the flow of the universe and the nature of things. Taoism encourages a principle of non-force, or wu-wei, as the means to live harmoniously with the Tao. Taoists believe the esoteric world is made up of a perfect harmonious balance and nature, while in the manifest world - particularly in the body - balance is distorted. The Three Jewels of the Tao - compassion, simplicity, and humility - serve as the basis for Taoist ethics. <br /><strong>Zoroastrianism</strong> - Originating from the teachings of Zoroaster in about the 9th or 10th century B.C., Zoroastrianism may be the oldest continuing creedal religion. Its key beliefs center on a transcendent creator God, Ahura Mazda, and the concept of free will. The key ethical tenets of Zoroastrianism expressed in its scripture, the Avesta, are based on a dualistic worldview where one may prevent chaos if one chooses to serve God and exercises good thoughts, good words, and good deeds. Zoroastrianism is generally a closed religion and members are almost always born to Zoroastrian parents. Prior to the spread of Islam, Zoroastrianism dominated greater Iran. Today, though a minority, Zoroastrians remain primarily in Iran, India (where they are known as Parsi), and Pakistan. <br /><strong>Traditional beliefs</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Animism: the belief that non-human entities contain souls or spirits.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Badimo: a form of ancestor worship of the Tswana people of Botswana.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Confucianism: an ideology that humans are perfectible through self-cultivation and self-creation; developed from teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius. Confucianism has strongly influenced the culture and beliefs of East Asian countries, including China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Inuit beliefs: a form of shamanism (see below) based on the animistic principles of the Inuit or Eskimo peoples.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Kirant: the belief system of the Kirat, a people who live mainly in the Himalayas of Nepal. It is primarily a form of polytheistic shamanism, but includes elements of animism and ancestor worship. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pagan is a blanket term used to describe many unconnected belief practices throughout history, usually in reference to religions outside of the Abrahamic category (monotheistic faiths including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Shamanism: beliefs and practices promoting communication with the spiritual world. Shamanistic beliefs are organized around a shaman or medicine man who - as an intermediary between the human and spirit world - is believed to be able to heal the sick (by healing their souls), communicate with the spirit world, and help souls into the afterlife through the practice of entering a trance. In shaman-based religions, the shaman is also responsible for leading sacred rites.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Spiritualism: the belief that souls and spirits communicate with the living usually through intermediaries called mediums. <br /><strong>Syncretic</strong> (fusion of diverse religious beliefs and practices) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cao Dai: a nationalistic Vietnamese sect, officially established in 1926, that draws practices and precepts from Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Catholicism.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Chondogyo: or the religion of the Heavenly Way, is based on Korean shamanism, Buddhism, and Korean folk traditions, with some elements drawn from Christianity. Formulated in the 1860s, it holds that God lives in all of us and strives to convert society into a paradise on earth, populated by believers transformed into intelligent moral beings with a high social conscience.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Kimbanguism: a puritan form of the Baptist denomination founded by Simon Kimbangu in the 1920s in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Adherents believe that salvation comes through Jesus' death and resurrection, like Christianity, but additionally that living a spiritually pure life following strict codes of conduct is required for salvation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Modekngei: a hybrid of Christianity and ancient Palauan culture and oral traditions founded around 1915 on the island of Babeldaob. Adherents simultaneously worship Jesus Christ and Palauan goddesses. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rastafarianism: an afro-centrist ideology and movement based on Christianity that arose in Jamaica in the 1930s; it believes that Haile Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930-74, was the incarnation of the second coming of Jesus.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Santeria: practiced in Cuba, the merging of the Yoruba religion of Nigeria with Roman Catholicism and native Indian traditions. Its practitioners believe that each person has a destiny and eventually transcends to merge with the divine creator and source of all energy, Olorun. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Voodoo/Vodun: a form of spirit and ancestor worship combined with some Christian faiths, especially Catholicism. Haitian and Louisiana Voodoo, which have included more Catholic practices, are separate from West African Vodun, which has retained a focus on spirit worship. <br /><strong>Non-religious</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Agnosticism: the belief that most things are unknowable. In regard to religion, it is usually characterized as neither a belief nor non-belief in a deity.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Atheism: the belief that there are no deities of any kind.","id":"religions","content":"Muslim 52.1%, Protestant 23.9%, Roman Catholic 20%, animist 0.3%, other Christian 0.2%, none 2.8%, unspecified 0.7% (2014-15 est.)"},{"title":"Demographic profile","comparative":false,"field_id":"340","definition":"This entry describes a country’s key demographic features and trends and how they vary among regional, ethnic, and socioeconomic sub-populations.

Chad has the world’s third highest maternal mortality rate. Among the primary risk factors are poverty, anemia, rural habitation, high fertility, poor education, and a lack of access to family planning and obstetric care.

Dependency ratios contrast the ratio of youths (ages 0-14) and the elderly (ages 65+) to the number of those in the working-age group (ages 15-64). Changes in the dependency ratio provide an indication of potential social support requirements resulting from changes in population age structures. As fertility levels decline, the dependency ratio initially falls because the proportion of youths decreases while the proportion of the population of working age increases. As fertility levels continue to decline, dependency ratios eventually increase because the proportion of the population of working age starts to decline and the proportion of elderly persons continues to increase.<br /><br /><em>total dependency ratio</em> - The total dependency ratio is the ratio of combined youth population (ages 0-14) and elderly population (ages 65+) per 100 people of working age (ages 15-64).

These infectious diseases represent risks to US Government personnel traveling to the specified country for a period of less than three years. The <em>degree of risk</em> is assessed by considering the foreign nature of these infectious diseases, their severity, and the probability of being affected by the diseases present. The diseases listed do not necessarily represent the total disease burden experienced by the local population.<br />The risk to an individual traveler varies considerably by the specific location, visit duration, type of activities, type of accommodations, time of year, and other factors. Consultation with a travel medicine physician is needed to evaluate individual risk and recommend appropriate preventive measures such as vaccines.<br />Diseases are organized into the following six exposure categories shown in italics <em>and listed in typical descending order of risk</em>. Note: The sequence of exposure categories listed in individual country entries may vary according to local conditions.<br /><br /><em>food or waterborne diseases</em> acquired through eating or drinking:<br /><strong>Hepatitis A</strong> - viral disease that interferes with the functioning of the liver; spread through consumption of food or water contaminated with fecal matter, principally in areas of poor sanitation; victims exhibit fever, jaundice, and diarrhea; 15% of victims will experience prolonged symptoms over 6-9 months; vaccine available.<br /><strong>Hepatitis E</strong> - water-borne viral disease that interferes with the functioning of the liver; most commonly spread through fecal contamination of drinking water; victims exhibit jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, and dark colored urine.<br /><strong>Typhoid fever</strong> - bacterial disease spread through contact with food or water contaminated by fecal matter or sewage; victims exhibit sustained high fevers; left untreated, mortality rates can reach 20%.<br /><br /><em>vector-borne diseases</em> acquired through the bite of an infected arthropod:<br /><strong>Malaria</strong> - caused by single-cell parasitic protozoa <em>Plasmodium</em>; transmitted to humans via the bite of the female <em>Anopheles</em> mosquito; parasites multiply in the liver attacking red blood cells resulting in cycles of fever, chills, and sweats accompanied by anemia; death due to damage to vital organs and interruption of blood supply to the brain; endemic in 85, mostly tropical, countries with 95% of cases and the majority of 0.4-0.6 million estimated annual deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa (six countries &ndash; Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, Angola and Burkina Faso &ndash; accounted for just over half of all malaria deaths globally in 2020).<br /><strong>Dengue fever</strong> - mosquito-borne (<em>Aedes aegypti</em>) viral disease associated with urban environments; manifests as sudden onset of fever and severe headache; occasionally produces shock and hemorrhage leading to death in 5% of cases.<br /><strong>Yellow fever</strong> - mosquito-borne (in urban areas <em>Aedes aegypti</em>) viral disease associated with urban environments; severity ranges from influenza-like symptoms to severe hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever; occurs only in tropical South America and sub-Saharan Africa, where most cases are reported; fatality rate is less than 20%.<br /><strong>Japanese Encephalitis</strong> - mosquito-borne (<em>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</em>) viral disease associated with rural areas in Asia; acute encephalitis can progress to paralysis, coma, and death; fatality rates 30%.<br /><strong>African Trypanosomiasis</strong> - caused by the parasitic protozoa<em> Trypanosoma</em>; transmitted to humans via the bite of bloodsucking tsetse flies; infection leads to malaise and irregular fevers and, in advanced cases when the parasites invade the central nervous system, coma and death; endemic in 36 countries of sub-Saharan Africa; cattle and wild animals act as reservoir hosts for the parasites.<br /><strong>Cutaneous Leishmaniasis</strong> - caused by the parasitic protozoa <em>leishmania</em>; transmitted to humans via the bite of sandflies; results in skin lesions that may become chronic; endemic in 88 countries; 90% of cases occur in Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Peru; wild and domesticated animals as well as humans can act as reservoirs of infection.<br /><strong>Plague</strong> - bacterial disease transmitted by fleas normally associated with rats; person-to-person airborne transmission also possible; recent plague epidemics occurred in areas of Asia, Africa, and South America associated with rural areas or small towns and villages; manifests as fever, headache, and painfully swollen lymph nodes; disease progresses rapidly and without antibiotic treatment leads to pneumonic form with a death rate in excess of 50%.<br /><strong>Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever</strong> - tick-borne viral disease; infection may also result from exposure to infected animal blood or tissue; geographic distribution includes Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe; sudden onset of fever, headache, and muscle aches followed by hemorrhaging in the bowels, urine, nose, and gums; mortality rate is approximately 30%.<br /><strong>Rift Valley fever</strong> - viral disease affecting domesticated animals and humans; transmission is by mosquito and other biting insects; infection may also occur through handling of infected meat or contact with blood; geographic distribution includes eastern and southern Africa where cattle and sheep are raised; symptoms are generally mild with fever and some liver abnormalities, but the disease may progress to hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, or ocular disease; fatality rates are low at about 1% of cases.<br /><strong>Chikungunya</strong> - mosquito-borne (<em>Aedes aegypti</em>) viral disease associated with urban environments, similar to Dengue Fever; characterized by sudden onset of fever, rash, and severe joint pain usually lasting 3-7 days, some cases result in persistent arthritis.<br /><br /><em>water-contact diseases</em> acquired through swimming or wading in freshwater lakes, streams, and rivers:<br /><strong>Leptospirosis</strong> - bacterial disease that affects animals and humans; infection occurs through contact with water, food, or soil contaminated by animal urine; symptoms include high fever, severe headache, vomiting, jaundice, and diarrhea; untreated, the disease can result in kidney damage, liver failure, meningitis, or respiratory distress; fatality rates are low but left untreated recovery can take months.<br /><strong>Schistosomiasis</strong> - caused by parasitic trematode flatworm <em>Schistosoma</em>; fresh water snails act as intermediate host and release larval form of parasite that penetrates the skin of people exposed to contaminated water; worms mature and reproduce in the blood vessels, liver, kidneys, and intestines releasing eggs, which become trapped in tissues triggering an immune response; may manifest as either urinary or intestinal disease resulting in decreased work or learning capacity; mortality, while generally low, may occur in advanced cases usually due to bladder cancer; endemic in 74 developing countries with 80% of infected people living in sub-Saharan Africa; humans act as the reservoir for this parasite.<br /><br /><em>aerosolized dust or soil-contact disease</em> acquired through inhalation of aerosols contaminated with rodent urine:<br /><strong>Lassa fever</strong> - viral disease carried by rats of the genus <em>Mastomys</em>; endemic in portions of West Africa; infection occurs through direct contact with or consumption of food contaminated by rodent urine or fecal matter containing virus particles; fatality rate can reach 50% in epidemic outbreaks.<br /><br /><em>respiratory disease</em> acquired through close contact with an infectious person:<br /><strong>Meningococcal meningitis</strong> - bacterial disease causing an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord; one of the most important bacterial pathogens is <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> because of its potential to cause epidemics; symptoms include stiff neck, high fever, headaches, and vomiting; bacteria are transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets and facilitated by close and prolonged contact resulting from crowded living conditions, often with a seasonal distribution; death occurs in 5-15% of cases, typically within 24-48 hours of onset of symptoms; highest burden of meningococcal disease occurs in the hyperendemic region of sub-Saharan Africa known as the \"Meningitis Belt\" which stretches from Senegal east to Ethiopia.<br /><br /><em>animal-contact disease</em> acquired through direct contact with local animals:<br /><strong>Rabies</strong> - viral disease of mammals usually transmitted through the bite of an infected animal, most commonly dogs; virus affects the central nervous system causing brain alteration and death; symptoms initially are non-specific fever and headache progressing to neurological symptoms; death occurs within days of the onset of symptoms.","id":"major-infectious-diseases","content":"<strong>degree of risk: </strong>very high (2020)<br><br><strong>food or waterborne diseases: </strong>bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A and E, and typhoid fever<br><br><strong>vectorborne diseases: </strong>malaria and dengue fever<br><br><strong>water contact diseases: </strong>schistosomiasis<br><br><strong>animal contact diseases: </strong>rabies<br><br><strong>respiratory diseases: </strong>meningococcal meningitis<br><br><strong>note: </strong>on 21 March 2022, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Travel Alert for polio in Africa;

The following terms and abbreviations are used throughout the entry: <br /><strong>Acidification</strong> - the lowering of soil and water pH due to acid precipitation and deposition usually through precipitation; this process disrupts ecosystem nutrient flows and may kill freshwater fish and plants dependent on more neutral or alkaline conditions (see acid rain). <br /><strong>Acid rain</strong> - characterized as containing harmful levels of sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxide; acid rain is damaging and potentially deadly to the earth's fragile ecosystems; acidity is measured using the pH scale where 7 is neutral, values greater than 7 are considered alkaline, and values below 5.6 are considered acid precipitation; note - a pH of 2.4 (the acidity of vinegar) has been measured in rainfall in New England. <br /><strong>Aerosol</strong> - a collection of airborne particles dispersed in a gas, smoke, or fog. <br /><strong>Afforestation</strong> - converting a bare or agricultural space by planting trees and plants; reforestation involves replanting trees on areas that have been cut or destroyed by fire. <br /><strong>Asbestos</strong> - a naturally occurring soft fibrous mineral commonly used in fireproofing materials and considered to be highly carcinogenic in particulate form. <br /><strong>Biodiversity</strong> - also biological diversity; the relative number of species, diverse in form and function, at the genetic, organism, community, and ecosystem level; loss of biodiversity reduces an ecosystem's ability to recover from natural or man-induced disruption. <br /><strong>Bio-indicators</strong> - a plant or animal species whose presence, abundance, and health reveal the general condition of its habitat. <br /><strong>Biomass</strong> - the total weight or volume of living matter in a given area or volume. <br /><strong>Carbon cycle</strong> - the term used to describe the exchange of carbon (in various forms, e.g., as carbon dioxide) between the atmosphere, ocean, terrestrial biosphere, and geological deposits. <br /><strong>Catchments</strong> - assemblages used to capture and retain rainwater and runoff; an important water management technique in areas with limited freshwater resources, such as Gibraltar. <br /><strong>DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane)</strong> - a colorless, odorless insecticide that has toxic effects on most animals; the use of DDT was banned in the US in 1972. <br /><strong>Defoliants</strong> - chemicals which cause plants to lose their leaves artificially; often used in agricultural practices for weed control, and may have detrimental impacts on human and ecosystem health. <br /><strong>Deforestation</strong> - the destruction of vast areas of forest (e.g., unsustainable forestry practices, agricultural and range land clearing, and the over exploitation of wood products for use as fuel) without planting new growth. <br /><strong>Desertification</strong> - the spread of desert-like conditions in arid or semi-arid areas, due to overgrazing, loss of agriculturally productive soils, or climate change. <br /><strong>Dredging</strong> - the practice of deepening an existing waterway; also, a technique used for collecting bottom-dwelling marine organisms (e.g., shellfish) or harvesting coral, often causing significant destruction of reef and ocean-floor ecosystems. <br /><strong>Drift-net fishing</strong> - done with a net, miles in extent, that is generally anchored to a boat and left to float with the tide; often results in an over harvesting and waste of large populations of non-commercial marine species (by-catch) by its effect of \"sweeping the ocean clean.\" <br /><strong>Ecosystems</strong> - ecological units comprised of complex communities of organisms and their specific environments. <br /><strong>Effluent</strong>s - waste materials, such as smoke, sewage, or industrial waste which are released into the environment, subsequently polluting it. <br /><strong>Endangered species</strong> - a species that is threatened with extinction either by direct hunting or habitat destruction. <br /><strong>Freshwater</strong> - water with very low soluble mineral content; sources include lakes, streams, rivers, glaciers, and underground aquifers. <br /><strong>Greenhouse gas</strong> - a gas that \"traps\" infrared radiation in the lower atmosphere causing surface warming; water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. <br /><strong>Groundwater</strong> - water sources found below the surface of the earth often in naturally occurring reservoirs in permeable rock strata; the source for wells and natural springs. <br /><strong>Highlands Water Project</strong> - a series of dams constructed jointly by Lesotho and South Africa to redirect Lesotho's abundant water supply into a rapidly growing area in South Africa; while it is the largest infrastructure project in southern Africa, it is also the most costly and controversial; objections to the project include claims that it forces people from their homes, submerges farmlands, and squanders economic resources. <br /><strong>Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC)</strong> - represents the roughly 150,000 Inuits of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia in international environmental issues; a General Assembly convenes every three years to determine the focus of the ICC; the most current concerns are long-range transport of pollutants, sustainable development, and climate change. <br /><strong>Metallurgical plants</strong> - industries which specialize in the science, technology, and processing of metals; these plants produce highly concentrated and toxic wastes which can contribute to pollution of ground water and air when not properly disposed. <br /><strong>Noxious substances</strong> - injurious, very harmful to living beings. <br /><strong>Overgrazing</strong> - the grazing of animals on plant material faster than it can naturally regrow leading to the permanent loss of plant cover, a common effect of too many animals grazing limited range land. <br /><strong>Ozone shield</strong> - a layer of the atmosphere composed of ozone gas (O3) that resides approximately 25 miles above the Earth's surface and absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation that can be harmful to living organisms. <br /><strong>Poaching</strong> - the illegal killing of animals or fish, a great concern with respect to endangered or threatened species. <br /><strong>Pollution</strong> - the contamination of a healthy environment by man-made waste. <br /><strong>Potable water</strong> - water that is drinkable, safe to be consumed. <br /><strong>Salination</strong> - the process through which fresh (drinkable) water becomes salt (undrinkable) water; hence, desalination is the reverse process; also involves the accumulation of salts in topsoil caused by evaporation of excessive irrigation water, a process that can eventually render soil incapable of supporting crops. <br /><strong>Siltation</strong> - occurs when water channels and reservoirs become clotted with silt and mud, a side effect of deforestation and soil erosion. <br /><strong>Slash-and-burn agriculture</strong> - a rotating cultivation technique in which trees are cut down and burned in order to clear land for temporary agriculture; the land is used until its productivity declines at which point a new plot is selected and the process repeats; this practice is sustainable while population levels are low and time is permitted for regrowth of natural vegetation; conversely, where these conditions do not exist, the practice can have disastrous consequences for the environment. <br /><strong>Soil degradation</strong> - damage to the land's productive capacity because of poor agricultural practices such as the excessive use of pesticides or fertilizers, soil compaction from heavy equipment, or erosion of topsoil, eventually resulting in reduced ability to produce agricultural products. <br /><strong>Soil erosion</strong> - the removal of soil by the action of water or wind, compounded by poor agricultural practices, deforestation, overgrazing, and desertification. <br /><strong>Ultraviolet (UV) radiation</strong> - a portion of the electromagnetic energy emitted by the sun and naturally filtered in the upper atmosphere by the ozone layer; UV radiation can be harmful to living organisms and has been linked to increasing rates of skin cancer in humans. <br /><strong>Waterborne diseases</strong> - those in which bacteria survive in, and are transmitted through, water; always a serious threat in areas with an untreated water supply.","id":"environment-current-issues","content":"inadequate supplies of potable water; improper waste disposal in rural areas and poor farming practices contribute to soil and water pollution;

Exposure to PM<sub>2.5 </sub>pollutants should not exceed an annual mean concentration of 10 micrograms per cubic meter, according to World Health Organization guidelines. Particulate matter are inhalable and respirable particles composed of sulphate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, mineral dust, and water. Fine particles less than 2.5 microns pose the greatest health risks because they can penetrate the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Sources include combustion engines, solid-fuel combustion, and other industrial activities. Exposure to high concentrations of particulate matter is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, although even low concentrations of particulate matter can impact health.

These infectious diseases represent risks to US Government personnel traveling to the specified country for a period of less than three years. The <em>degree of risk</em> is assessed by considering the foreign nature of these infectious diseases, their severity, and the probability of being affected by the diseases present. The diseases listed do not necessarily represent the total disease burden experienced by the local population.<br />The risk to an individual traveler varies considerably by the specific location, visit duration, type of activities, type of accommodations, time of year, and other factors. Consultation with a travel medicine physician is needed to evaluate individual risk and recommend appropriate preventive measures such as vaccines.<br />Diseases are organized into the following six exposure categories shown in italics <em>and listed in typical descending order of risk</em>. Note: The sequence of exposure categories listed in individual country entries may vary according to local conditions.<br /><br /><em>food or waterborne diseases</em> acquired through eating or drinking:<br /><strong>Hepatitis A</strong> - viral disease that interferes with the functioning of the liver; spread through consumption of food or water contaminated with fecal matter, principally in areas of poor sanitation; victims exhibit fever, jaundice, and diarrhea; 15% of victims will experience prolonged symptoms over 6-9 months; vaccine available.<br /><strong>Hepatitis E</strong> - water-borne viral disease that interferes with the functioning of the liver; most commonly spread through fecal contamination of drinking water; victims exhibit jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, and dark colored urine.<br /><strong>Typhoid fever</strong> - bacterial disease spread through contact with food or water contaminated by fecal matter or sewage; victims exhibit sustained high fevers; left untreated, mortality rates can reach 20%.<br /><br /><em>vector-borne diseases</em> acquired through the bite of an infected arthropod:<br /><strong>Malaria</strong> - caused by single-cell parasitic protozoa <em>Plasmodium</em>; transmitted to humans via the bite of the female <em>Anopheles</em> mosquito; parasites multiply in the liver attacking red blood cells resulting in cycles of fever, chills, and sweats accompanied by anemia; death due to damage to vital organs and interruption of blood supply to the brain; endemic in 85, mostly tropical, countries with 95% of cases and the majority of 0.4-0.6 million estimated annual deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa (six countries &ndash; Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, Angola and Burkina Faso &ndash; accounted for just over half of all malaria deaths globally in 2020).<br /><strong>Dengue fever</strong> - mosquito-borne (<em>Aedes aegypti</em>) viral disease associated with urban environments; manifests as sudden onset of fever and severe headache; occasionally produces shock and hemorrhage leading to death in 5% of cases.<br /><strong>Yellow fever</strong> - mosquito-borne (in urban areas <em>Aedes aegypti</em>) viral disease associated with urban environments; severity ranges from influenza-like symptoms to severe hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever; occurs only in tropical South America and sub-Saharan Africa, where most cases are reported; fatality rate is less than 20%.<br /><strong>Japanese Encephalitis</strong> - mosquito-borne (<em>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</em>) viral disease associated with rural areas in Asia; acute encephalitis can progress to paralysis, coma, and death; fatality rates 30%.<br /><strong>African Trypanosomiasis</strong> - caused by the parasitic protozoa<em> Trypanosoma</em>; transmitted to humans via the bite of bloodsucking tsetse flies; infection leads to malaise and irregular fevers and, in advanced cases when the parasites invade the central nervous system, coma and death; endemic in 36 countries of sub-Saharan Africa; cattle and wild animals act as reservoir hosts for the parasites.<br /><strong>Cutaneous Leishmaniasis</strong> - caused by the parasitic protozoa <em>leishmania</em>; transmitted to humans via the bite of sandflies; results in skin lesions that may become chronic; endemic in 88 countries; 90% of cases occur in Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Peru; wild and domesticated animals as well as humans can act as reservoirs of infection.<br /><strong>Plague</strong> - bacterial disease transmitted by fleas normally associated with rats; person-to-person airborne transmission also possible; recent plague epidemics occurred in areas of Asia, Africa, and South America associated with rural areas or small towns and villages; manifests as fever, headache, and painfully swollen lymph nodes; disease progresses rapidly and without antibiotic treatment leads to pneumonic form with a death rate in excess of 50%.<br /><strong>Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever</strong> - tick-borne viral disease; infection may also result from exposure to infected animal blood or tissue; geographic distribution includes Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe; sudden onset of fever, headache, and muscle aches followed by hemorrhaging in the bowels, urine, nose, and gums; mortality rate is approximately 30%.<br /><strong>Rift Valley fever</strong> - viral disease affecting domesticated animals and humans; transmission is by mosquito and other biting insects; infection may also occur through handling of infected meat or contact with blood; geographic distribution includes eastern and southern Africa where cattle and sheep are raised; symptoms are generally mild with fever and some liver abnormalities, but the disease may progress to hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, or ocular disease; fatality rates are low at about 1% of cases.<br /><strong>Chikungunya</strong> - mosquito-borne (<em>Aedes aegypti</em>) viral disease associated with urban environments, similar to Dengue Fever; characterized by sudden onset of fever, rash, and severe joint pain usually lasting 3-7 days, some cases result in persistent arthritis.<br /><br /><em>water-contact diseases</em> acquired through swimming or wading in freshwater lakes, streams, and rivers:<br /><strong>Leptospirosis</strong> - bacterial disease that affects animals and humans; infection occurs through contact with water, food, or soil contaminated by animal urine; symptoms include high fever, severe headache, vomiting, jaundice, and diarrhea; untreated, the disease can result in kidney damage, liver failure, meningitis, or respiratory distress; fatality rates are low but left untreated recovery can take months.<br /><strong>Schistosomiasis</strong> - caused by parasitic trematode flatworm <em>Schistosoma</em>; fresh water snails act as intermediate host and release larval form of parasite that penetrates the skin of people exposed to contaminated water; worms mature and reproduce in the blood vessels, liver, kidneys, and intestines releasing eggs, which become trapped in tissues triggering an immune response; may manifest as either urinary or intestinal disease resulting in decreased work or learning capacity; mortality, while generally low, may occur in advanced cases usually due to bladder cancer; endemic in 74 developing countries with 80% of infected people living in sub-Saharan Africa; humans act as the reservoir for this parasite.<br /><br /><em>aerosolized dust or soil-contact disease</em> acquired through inhalation of aerosols contaminated with rodent urine:<br /><strong>Lassa fever</strong> - viral disease carried by rats of the genus <em>Mastomys</em>; endemic in portions of West Africa; infection occurs through direct contact with or consumption of food contaminated by rodent urine or fecal matter containing virus particles; fatality rate can reach 50% in epidemic outbreaks.<br /><br /><em>respiratory disease</em> acquired through close contact with an infectious person:<br /><strong>Meningococcal meningitis</strong> - bacterial disease causing an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord; one of the most important bacterial pathogens is <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> because of its potential to cause epidemics; symptoms include stiff neck, high fever, headaches, and vomiting; bacteria are transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets and facilitated by close and prolonged contact resulting from crowded living conditions, often with a seasonal distribution; death occurs in 5-15% of cases, typically within 24-48 hours of onset of symptoms; highest burden of meningococcal disease occurs in the hyperendemic region of sub-Saharan Africa known as the \"Meningitis Belt\" which stretches from Senegal east to Ethiopia.<br /><br /><em>animal-contact disease</em> acquired through direct contact with local animals:<br /><strong>Rabies</strong> - viral disease of mammals usually transmitted through the bite of an infected animal, most commonly dogs; virus affects the central nervous system causing brain alteration and death; symptoms initially are non-specific fever and headache progressing to neurological symptoms; death occurs within days of the onset of symptoms.","id":"major-infectious-diseases","content":"<strong>degree of risk: </strong>very high (2020)<br><br><strong>food or waterborne diseases: </strong>bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A and E, and typhoid fever<br><br><strong>vectorborne diseases: </strong>malaria and dengue fever<br><br><strong>water contact diseases: </strong>schistosomiasis<br><br><strong>animal contact diseases: </strong>rabies<br><br><strong>respiratory diseases: </strong>meningococcal meningitis<br><br><strong>note: </strong>on 21 March 2022, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Travel Alert for polio in Africa;

Definitions of the major governmental terms are as follows. (Note that for some countries more than one definition applies.):\n\n<br><b>Absolute monarchy</b> - a form of government where the monarch rules unhindered, i.e., without any laws, constitution, or legally organized opposition.\n\n<br><b>Anarchy</b> - a condition of lawlessness or political disorder brought about by the absence of governmental authority. \n\n<br><b>Authoritarian</b> - a form of government in which state authority is imposed onto many aspects of citizens' lives.\n\n<br><b>Commonwealth</b> - a nation, state, or other political entity founded on law and united by a compact of the people for the common good. \n\n<br><b>Communist</b> - a system of government in which the state plans and controls the economy and a single - often authoritarian - party holds power; state controls are imposed with the elimination of private ownership of property or capital while claiming to make progress toward a higher social order in which all goods are equally shared by the people (i.e., a classless society). \n\n<br><b>Confederacy (Confederation)</b> - a union by compact or treaty between states, provinces, or territories, that creates a central government with limited powers; the constituent entities retain supreme authority over all matters except those delegated to the central government. \n\n<br><b>Constitutional</b> - a government by or operating under an authoritative document (constitution) that sets forth the system of fundamental laws and principles that determines the nature, functions, and limits of that government. \n\n<br><b>Constitutional democracy</b> - a form of government in which the sovereign power of the people is spelled out in a governing constitution. \n\n<br><b>Constitutional monarchy</b> - a system of government in which a monarch is guided by a constitution whereby his/her rights, duties, and responsibilities are spelled out in written law or by custom. \n\n<br><b>Democracy</b> - a form of government in which the supreme power is retained by the people, but which is usually exercised indirectly through a system of representation and delegated authority periodically renewed. \n\n<br><b>Democratic republic</b> - a state in which the supreme power rests in the body of citizens entitled to vote for officers and representatives responsible to them. \n\n<br><b>Dictatorship</b> - a form of government in which a ruler or small clique wield absolute power (not restricted by a constitution or laws). \n\n<br><b>Ecclesiastical</b> - a government administrated by a church.\n\n<br><b>Emirate</b> - similar to a monarchy or sultanate, but a government in which the supreme power is in the hands of an emir (the ruler of a Muslim state); the emir may be an absolute overlord or a sovereign with constitutionally limited authority. \n\n<br><b>Federal (Federation)</b> - a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided - usually by means of a constitution - between a central authority and a number of constituent regions (states, colonies, or provinces) so that each region retains some management of its internal affairs; differs from a confederacy in that the central government exerts influence directly upon both individuals as well as upon the regional units. \n\n<br><b>Federal republic</b> - a state in which the powers of the central government are restricted and in which the component parts (states, colonies, or provinces) retain a degree of self-government; ultimate sovereign power rests with the voters who chose their governmental representatives.\n\n<br><b>Islamic republic</b> - a particular form of government adopted by some Muslim states; although such a state is, in theory, a theocracy, it remains a republic, but its laws are required to be compatible with the laws of Islam. \n\n<br><b>Maoism</b> - the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism developed in China by Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung), which states that a continuous revolution is necessary if the leaders of a communist state are to keep in touch with the people. \n\n<br><b>Marxism</b> - the political, economic, and social principles espoused by 19th century economist Karl Marx; he viewed the struggle of workers as a progression of historical forces that would proceed from a class struggle of the proletariat (workers) exploited by capitalists (business owners), to a socialist\"dictatorship of the proletariat,\" to, finally, a classless society - Communism. \n\n<br><b>Marxism-Leninism</b> - an expanded form of communism developed by Lenin from doctrines of Karl Marx; Lenin saw imperialism as the final stage of capitalism and shifted the focus of workers' struggle from developed to underdeveloped countries. \n\n<br><b>Monarchy</b> - a government in which the supreme power is lodged in the hands of a monarch who reigns over a state or territory, usually for life and by hereditary right; the monarch may be either a sole absolute ruler or a sovereign - such as a king, queen, or prince - with constitutionally limited authority. \n\n<br><b>Oligarchy</b> - a government in which control is exercised by a small group of individuals whose authority generally is based on wealth or power. \n\n<br><b>Parliamentary democracy</b> - a political system in which the legislature (parliament) selects the government - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor along with the cabinet ministers - according to party strength as expressed in elections; by this system, the government acquires a dual responsibility: to the people as well as to the parliament. \n\n<br><b>Parliamentary government (Cabinet-Parliamentary government)</b> - a government in which members of an executive branch (the cabinet and its leader - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor) are nominated to their positions by a legislature or parliament, and are directly responsible to it; this type of government can be dissolved at will by the parliament (legislature) by means of a no confidence vote or the leader of the cabinet may dissolve the parliament if it can no longer function. \n\n<br><b>Parliamentary monarchy</b> - a state headed by a monarch who is not actively involved in policy formation or implementation (i.e., the exercise of sovereign powers by a monarch in a ceremonial capacity); true governmental leadership is carried out by a cabinet and its head - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor - who are drawn from a legislature (parliament). \n\n<br><b>Presidential</b> - a system of government where the executive branch exists separately from a legislature (to which it is generally not accountable). \n\n<br><b>Republic</b> - a representative democracy in which the people's elected deputies (representatives), not the people themselves, vote on legislation.\n\n<br><b>Socialism</b> - a government in which the means of planning, producing, and distributing goods is controlled by a central government that theoretically seeks a more just and equitable distribution of property and labor; in actuality, most socialist governments have ended up being no more than dictatorships over workers by a ruling elite. \n\n<br><b>Sultanate</b> - similar to a monarchy, but a government in which the supreme power is in the hands of a sultan (the head of a Muslim state); the sultan may be an absolute ruler or a sovereign with constitutionally limited authority. \n\n<br><b>Theocracy</b> - a form of government in which a Deity is recognized as the supreme civil ruler, but the Deity's laws are interpreted by ecclesiastical authorities (bishops, mullahs, etc.); a government subject to religious authority.\n\n<br><b>Totalitarian</b> - a government that seeks to subordinate the individual to the state by controlling not only all political and economic matters, but also the attitudes, values, and beliefs of its population.","id":"government-type","content":"presidential republic"},{"title":"Capital","comparative":false,"subfields_raw":"name, geographic coordinates, time difference, daylight saving time, time zone note, etymology","field_id":"301","definition":"This entry gives the <em>name</em> of the seat of government, its <em>geographic coordinates</em>, the <em>time difference</em> relative to <strong>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</strong> and the time observed in Washington, DC, and, if applicable, information on <em>daylight saving time</em> <strong>(DST)</strong>.

Terms commonly used to describe constitutional changes are &ldquo;amended,&rdquo; &ldquo;revised,&rdquo; or &ldquo;reformed.&rdquo; In countries such as South Korea and Turkmenistan, sources differ as to whether changes are stated as new constitutions or are amendments/revisions to existing ones.<br /><br />A few countries including Canada, Israel, and the UK, have no single constitution document, but have various written and unwritten acts, statutes, common laws, and practices that, when taken together, describe a body of fundamental principles or established precedents as to how their countries are governed. Some special regions (Hong Kong, Macau) and countries (Oman, Saudi Arabia) use the term &ldquo;basic law&rdquo; instead of constitution.<br /><br />A number of self-governing dependencies and territories, such as the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and Gibraltar (UK), Greenland and Faroe Islands (Denmark), Aruba, Curacao, and Sint Maarten (Netherlands), and Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands (US), have their own constitutions.","id":"constitution","content":"<strong>history: </strong>several previous; latest approved 30 April 2018 by the National Assembly, entered into force 4 May 2018; suspended 21 April 2021 (2021)<br><br><strong>amendments: </strong>proposed as a revision by the president of the republic after a Council of Ministers (cabinet) decision or by the National Assembly; approval for consideration of a revision requires at least three-fifths majority vote by the Assembly; passage requires approval by referendum or at least two-thirds majority vote by the Assembly (2021)"},{"title":"Legal system","comparative":false,"field_id":"308","definition":"This entry provides the description of a country's legal system. A statement on judicial review of legislative acts is also included for a number of countries. The legal systems of nearly all countries are generally modeled upon elements of five main types: civil law (including French law, the Napoleonic Code, Roman law, Roman-Dutch law, and Spanish law); common law (including United State law); customary law; mixed or pluralistic law; and religious law (including Islamic law). An additional type of legal system - international law, which governs the conduct of independent nations in their relationships with one another - is also addressed below. The following list describes these legal systems, the countries or world regions where these systems are enforced, and a brief statement on the origins and major features of each. <br /><strong>Civil Law</strong> - The most widespread type of legal system in the world, applied in various forms in approximately 150 countries. Also referred to as European continental law, the civil law system is derived mainly from the Roman <em>Corpus Juris Civilus</em>, (Body of Civil Law), a collection of laws and legal interpretations compiled under the East Roman (Byzantine) Emperor Justinian I between A.D. 528 and 565. The major feature of civil law systems is that the laws are organized into systematic written codes. In civil law the sources recognized as authoritative are principally legislation - especially codifications in constitutions or statutes enacted by governments - and secondarily, custom. The civil law systems in some countries are based on more than one code. <br /><strong>Common Law</strong> - A type of legal system, often synonymous with \"English common law,\" which is the system of England and Wales in the UK, and is also in force in approximately 80 countries formerly part of or influenced by the former British Empire. English common law reflects Biblical influences as well as remnants of law systems imposed by early conquerors including the Romans, Anglo-Saxons, and Normans. Some legal scholars attribute the formation of the English common law system to King Henry II (r.1154-1189). Until the time of his reign, laws customary among England's various manorial and ecclesiastical (church) jurisdictions were administered locally. Henry II established the king's court and designated that laws were \"common\" to the entire English realm. The foundation of English common law is \"legal precedent\" - referred to as <em>stare decisis</em>, meaning \"to stand by things decided.\" In the English common law system, court judges are bound in their decisions in large part by the rules and other doctrines developed - and supplemented over time - by the judges of earlier English courts. <br /><strong>Customary Law</strong> - A type of legal system that serves as the basis of, or has influenced, the present-day laws in approximately 40 countries - mostly in Africa, but some in the Pacific islands, Europe, and the Near East. Customary law is also referred to as \"primitive law,\" \"unwritten law,\" \"indigenous law,\" and \"folk law.\" There is no single history of customary law such as that found in Roman civil law, English common law, Islamic law, or the Napoleonic Civil Code. The earliest systems of law in human society were customary, and usually developed in small agrarian and hunter-gatherer communities. As the term implies, customary law is based upon the customs of a community. Common attributes of customary legal systems are that they are seldom written down, they embody an organized set of rules regulating social relations, and they are agreed upon by members of the community. Although such law systems include sanctions for law infractions, resolution tends to be reconciliatory rather than punitive. A number of African states practiced customary law many centuries prior to colonial influences. Following colonization, such laws were written down and incorporated to varying extents into the legal systems imposed by their colonial powers. <br /><strong>European Union Law</strong> - A sub-discipline of international law known as \"supranational law\" in which the rights of sovereign nations are limited in relation to one another. Also referred to as the Law of the European Union or Community Law, it is the unique and complex legal system that operates in tandem with the laws of the 27 member states of the European Union (EU). Similar to federal states, the EU legal system ensures compliance from the member states because of the Union's decentralized political nature. The European Court of Justice (ECJ), established in 1952 by the Treaty of Paris, has been largely responsible for the development of EU law. Fundamental principles of European Union law include: <em>subsidiarity</em> - the notion that issues be handled by the smallest, lowest, or least centralized competent authority; <em>proportionality</em> - the EU may only act to the extent needed to achieve its objectives; <em>conferral</em> - the EU is a union of member states, and all its authorities are voluntarily granted by its members; <em>legal certainty</em> - requires that legal rules be clear and precise; and <em>precautionary principle</em> - a moral and political principle stating that if an action or policy might cause severe or irreversible harm to the public or to the environment, in the absence of a scientific consensus that harm would not ensue, the burden of proof falls on those who would advocate taking the action. <br /><strong>French Law</strong> - A type of civil law that is the legal system of France. The French system also serves as the basis for, or is mixed with, other legal systems in approximately 50 countries, notably in North Africa, the Near East, and the French territories and dependencies. French law is primarily codified or systematic written civil law. Prior to the French Revolution (1789-1799), France had no single national legal system. Laws in the northern areas of present-day France were mostly local customs based on privileges and exemptions granted by kings and feudal lords, while in the southern areas Roman law predominated. The introduction of the Napoleonic Civil Code during the reign of Napoleon I in the first decade of the 19th century brought major reforms to the French legal system, many of which remain part of France's current legal structure, though all have been extensively amended or redrafted to address a modern nation. French law distinguishes between\"public law\" and \"private law.\" Public law relates to government, the French Constitution, public administration, and criminal law. Private law covers issues between private citizens or corporations. The most recent changes to the French legal system - introduced in the 1980s - were the decentralization laws, which transferred authority from centrally appointed government representatives to locally elected representatives of the people. <br /><strong>International Law</strong> - The law of the international community, or the body of customary rules and treaty rules accepted as legally binding by states in their relations with each other. International law differs from other legal systems in that it primarily concerns sovereign political entities. There are three separate disciplines of international law: public international law, which governs the relationship between provinces and international entities and includes treaty law, law of the sea, international criminal law, and international humanitarian law; private international law, which addresses legal jurisdiction; and supranational law - a legal framework wherein countries are bound by regional agreements in which the laws of the member countries are held inapplicable when in conflict with supranational laws. At present the European Union is the only entity under a supranational legal system. The term \"international law\" was coined by Jeremy Bentham in 1780 in his <em>Principles of Morals and Legislation</em>, though laws governing relations between states have been recognized from very early times (many centuries B.C.). Modern international law developed alongside the emergence and growth of the European nation-states beginning in the early 16th century. Other factors that influenced the development of international law included the revival of legal studies, the growth of international trade, and the practice of exchanging emissaries and establishing legations. The sources of International law are set out in Article 38-1 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice within the UN Charter. <br /><strong>Islamic Law</strong> - The most widespread type of religious law, it is the legal system enforced in over 30 countries, particularly in the Near East, but also in Central and South Asia, Africa, and Indonesia. In many countries Islamic law operates in tandem with a civil law system. Islamic law is embodied in the sharia, an Arabic word meaning\"the right path.\" Sharia covers all aspects of public and private life and organizes them into five categories: obligatory, recommended, permitted, disliked, and forbidden. The primary sources of sharia law are the Qur'an, believed by Muslims to be the word of God revealed to the Prophet Muhammad by the angel Gabriel, and the Sunnah, the teachings of the Prophet and his works. In addition to these two primary sources, traditional Sunni Muslims recognize the consensus of Muhammad's companions and Islamic jurists on certain issues, called ijmas, and various forms of reasoning, including analogy by legal scholars, referred to as qiyas. Shia Muslims reject ijmas and qiyas as sources of sharia law. <br /><strong>Mixed Law</strong> - Also referred to as pluralistic law, mixed law consists of elements of some or all of the other main types of legal systems - civil, common, customary, and religious. The mixed legal systems of a number of countries came about when colonial powers overlaid their own legal systems upon colonized regions but retained elements of the colonies' existing legal systems. <br /><strong>Napoleonic Civil Code</strong> - A type of civil law, referred to as the Civil Code or <em>Code Civil des Francais</em>, forms part of the legal system of France, and underpins the legal systems of Bolivia, Egypt, Lebanon, Poland, and the US state of Louisiana. The Civil Code was established under Napoleon I, enacted in 1804, and officially designated the <em>Code Napoleon</em> in 1807. This legal system combined the Teutonic civil law tradition of the northern provinces of France with the Roman law tradition of the southern and eastern regions of the country. The Civil Code bears similarities in its arrangement to the Roman <em>Body of Civil Law</em> (see Civil Law above). As enacted in 1804, the Code addressed personal status, property, and the acquisition of property. Codes added over the following six years included civil procedures, commercial law, criminal law and procedures, and a penal code. <br /><strong>Religious Law</strong> - A legal system which stems from the sacred texts of religious traditions and in most cases professes to cover all aspects of life as a seamless part of devotional obligations to a transcendent, imminent, or deep philosophical reality. Implied as the basis of religious law is the concept of unalterability, because the word of God cannot be amended or legislated against by judges or governments. However, a detailed legal system generally requires human elaboration. The main types of religious law are sharia in Islam, halakha in Judaism, and canon law in some Christian groups. Sharia is the most widespread religious legal system (see Islamic Law), and is the sole system of law for countries including Iran, the Maldives, and Saudi Arabia. No country is fully governed by halakha, but Jewish people may decide to settle disputes through Jewish courts and be bound by their rulings. Canon law is not a divine law as such because it is not found in revelation. It is viewed instead as human law inspired by the word of God and applying the demands of that revelation to the actual situation of the church. Canon law regulates the internal ordering of the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Anglican Communion. <br /><strong>Roman Law</strong> - A type of civil law developed in ancient Rome and practiced from the time of the city's founding (traditionally 753 B.C.) until the fall of the Western Empire in the 5th century A.D. Roman law remained the legal system of the Byzantine (Eastern Empire) until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Preserved fragments of the first legal text, known as the Law of the Twelve Tables, dating from the 5th century B.C., contained specific provisions designed to change the prevailing customary law. Early Roman law was drawn from custom and statutes; later, during the time of the empire, emperors asserted their authority as the ultimate source of law. The basis for Roman laws was the idea that the exact form - not the intention - of words or of actions produced legal consequences. It was only in the late 6th century A.D. that a comprehensive Roman code of laws was published (see Civil Law above). Roman law served as the basis of law systems developed in a number of continental European countries. <br /><strong>Roman-Dutch Law</strong> - A type of civil law based on Roman law as applied in the Netherlands. Roman-Dutch law serves as the basis for legal systems in seven African countries, as well as Guyana, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. This law system, which originated in the province of Holland and expanded throughout the Netherlands (to be replaced by the French Civil Code in 1809), was instituted in a number of sub-Saharan African countries during the Dutch colonial period. The Dutch jurist/philosopher Hugo Grotius was the first to attempt to reduce Roman-Dutch civil law into a system in his <em>Jurisprudence of Holland</em> (written 1619-20, commentary published 1621). The Dutch historian/lawyer Simon van Leeuwen coined the term \"Roman-Dutch law\" in 1652. <br /><strong>Spanish Law</strong> - A type of civil law, often referred to as the Spanish Civil Code, it is the present legal system of Spain and is the basis of legal systems in 12 countries mostly in Central and South America, but also in southwestern Europe, northern and western Africa, and southeastern Asia. The Spanish Civil Code reflects a complex mixture of customary, Roman, Napoleonic, local, and modern codified law. The laws of the Visigoth invaders of Spain in the 5th to 7th centuries had the earliest major influence on Spanish legal system development. The Christian Reconquest of Spain in the 11th through 15th centuries witnessed the development of customary law, which combined canon (religious) and Roman law. During several centuries of Hapsburg and Bourbon rule, systematic recompilations of the existing national legal system were attempted, but these often conflicted with local and regional customary civil laws. Legal system development for most of the 19th century concentrated on formulating a national civil law system, which was finally enacted in 1889 as the Spanish Civil Code. Several sections of the code have been revised, the most recent of which are the penal code in 1989 and the judiciary code in 2001. The Spanish Civil Code separates public and private law. Public law includes constitutional law, administrative law, criminal law, process law, financial and tax law, and international public law. Private law includes civil law, commercial law, labor law, and international private law. <br /><strong>United States Law</strong> - A type of common law, which is the basis of the legal system of the United States and that of its island possessions in the Caribbean and the Pacific. This legal system has several layers, more possibly than in most other countries, and is due in part to the division between federal and state law. The United States was founded not as one nation but as a union of 13 colonies, each claiming independence from the British Crown. The US Constitution, implemented in 1789, began shifting power away from the states and toward the federal government, though the states today retain substantial legal authority. US law draws its authority from four sources: <em>constitutional law</em>, <em>statutory law</em>, <em>administrative regulations</em>, and <em>case law</em>. Constitutional law is based on the US Constitution and serves as the supreme federal law. Taken together with those of the state constitutions, these documents outline the general structure of the federal and state governments and provide the rules and limits of power. US statutory law is legislation enacted by the US Congress and is codified in the United States Code. The 50 state legislatures have similar authority to enact state statutes. Administrative law is the authority delegated to federal and state executive agencies. Case law, also referred to as common law, covers areas where constitutional or statutory law is lacking. Case law is a collection of judicial decisions, customs, and general principles that began in England centuries ago, that were adopted in America at the time of the Revolution, and that continue to develop today.","id":"legal-system","content":"mixed legal system of civil and customary law"},{"title":"International law organization participation","comparative":false,"field_id":"309","definition":"This entry includes information on a country's acceptance of jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and of the International Criminal Court (ICCt); 61 countries have accepted ICJ jurisdiction with reservations and 12 have accepted ICJ jurisdiction without reservations; 123 countries and the Palestine Liberation Organization have accepted ICCt jurisdiction. <a href=\"/the-world-factbook/references/international-organizations-and-groups/\">Appendix B: International Organizations and Groups</a> explains the differing mandates of the ICJ and ICCt.","id":"international-law-organization-participation","content":"has not submitted an ICJ jurisdiction declaration; accepts ICCt jurisdiction"},{"title":"Citizenship","comparative":false,"subfields_raw":"citizenship by birth, citizenship by descent only, dual citizenship recognized, residency requirement for naturalization","field_id":"310","definition":"This entry provides information related to the acquisition and exercise of citizenship; it includes four subfields:<br /><br /> <em>citizenship by birth</em> describes the acquisition of citizenship based on place of birth, known as <em>Jus soli</em>, regardless of the citizenship of parents.<br /><br /> <em>citizenship by descent only</em> describes the acquisition of citizenship based on the principle of <em>Jus sanguinis</em>, or by descent, where at least one parent is a citizen of the state and being born within the territorial limits of the state is not required. The majority of countries adhere to this practice. In some cases, citizenship is conferred through the father or mother exclusively.<br /><br /> <em>dual citizenship recognized</em> indicates whether a state permits a citizen to simultaneously hold citizenship in another state. Many states do not permit dual citizenship and the voluntary acquisition of citizenship in another country is grounds for revocation of citizenship. Holding dual citizenship makes an individual legally obligated to more than one state and can negate the normal consular protections afforded to citizens outside their original country of citizenship.<br /><br /> <em>residency requirement for naturalization</em> lists the length of time an applicant is required to live in a state before applying for naturalization. In most countries citizenship can be acquired through the legal process of naturalization. The requirements for naturalization vary by state but generally include no criminal record, good health, economic wherewithal, and a period of authorized residency in the state. This time period can vary enormously among states and is often used to make the acquisition of citizenship difficult or impossible.","id":"citizenship","content":"<strong>citizenship by birth: </strong>no<br><br><strong>citizenship by descent only: </strong>both parents must be citizens of Chad<br><br><strong>dual citizenship recognized: </strong>Chadian law does not address dual citizenship<br><br><strong>residency requirement for naturalization: </strong>15 years"},{"title":"Suffrage","comparative":false,"field_id":"311","definition":"This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the right to vote is universal or restricted.","id":"suffrage","content":"18 years of age; universal"},{"title":"Executive branch","comparative":false,"subfields_raw":"chief of state, head of government, cabinet, elections/appointments, election results, head of state","field_id":"312","definition":"This entry includes five subentries: <em>chief of state; head of government; cabinet; elections/appointments; election results</em>. <em>Chief of state</em> includes the name, title, and beginning date in office of the titular leader of the country who represents the state at official and ceremonial functions but may not be involved with the day-to-day activities of the government. <em>Head of government</em> includes the name, title of the top executive designated to manage the executive branch of the government, and the beginning date in office. <em>Cabinet</em> includes the official name of the executive branch’s high-ranking body and the method of member selection. <em>Elections/appointments</em> includes the process for accession to office, date of the last election, and date of the next election. <em>Election results</em> includes each candidate's political affiliation, percent of direct popular vote or indirect legislative/parliamentary percent vote or vote count in the last election.<br><br>\nThe executive branches in approximately 80% of the world's countries have separate chiefs of state and heads of government; for the remainder, the chief of state is also the head of government, such as in Argentina, Kenya, the Philippines, the US, and Venezuela.

The <em>description</em> subfield provides the legislative structure (unicameral – single house; bicameral – an upper and a lower house); formal name(s); number of member seats; types of constituencies or voting districts (single seat, multi-seat, nationwide); electoral voting system(s); and member term of office. The elections subfield includes the dates of the last election and next election. The <em>election results</em> subfield lists <em>percent of vote by party/coalition</em> and <em>number of seats by party/coalition</em> in the last election (in bicameral legislatures, upper house results are listed first). In general, parties with less than four seats and less than 4 percent of the vote are aggregated and listed as \"other,\" and non-party-affiliated seats are listed as \"independent.\" Also, the entries for some countries include two sets of <em>percent of vote by party</em> and <em>seats by party</em>; the former reflects results following a formal election announcement, and the latter – following a mid-term or byelection – reflects changes in a legislature’s political party composition.<br><br>\nOf the approximately 240 countries with legislative bodies, approximately two-thirds are unicameral, and the remainder, bicameral. The selection of legislative members is typically governed by a country's constitution and/or its electoral laws. In general, members are either directly elected by a country's eligible voters using a defined electoral system; indirectly elected or selected by its province, state, or department legislatures; or appointed by the country's executive body. Legislative members in many countries are selected both directly and indirectly, and the electoral laws of some countries reserve seats for women and various ethnic and minority groups.<br><br> \nWorldwide, the two predominant direct voting systems are plurality/majority and proportional representation. The most common of the several plurality/majority systems is simple majority vote, or first-past-the-post, in which the candidate receiving the most votes is elected. Countries' legislatures such as Bangladesh's Parliament, Malaysia's House of Representatives, and the United Kingdom's House of Commons use this system. Another common plurality/majority system – absolute majority or two-round – requires that candidates win at least 50 percent of the votes to be elected. If none of the candidates meets that vote threshold in the initial election, a second poll or\"runoff\" is held soon after for the two top vote getters, and the candidate receiving a simple vote majority is declared the winner. Examples of the two-round system are Haiti's Chamber of Deputies, Mali's National Assembly, and Uzbekistan's Legislative Chamber. Other plurality/majority voting systems, referred to as preferential voting and generally used in multi-seat constituencies, are block vote and single non-transferable vote, in which voters cast their ballots by ranking their candidate preferences from highest to lowest.<br><br>\nProportional representation electoral systems – in contrast to plurality/majority systems – generally award legislative seats to political parties in approximate proportion to the number of votes each receives. For example, in a 100-member legislature, if Party A receives 50 percent of the total vote, Party B, 30 percent, and Party C, 20 percent, then Party A would be awarded 50 seats, Party B 30 seats, and Party C 20 seats. There are various forms of proportional representation and the degree of reaching proportionality varies. Some forms of proportional representation are focused solely on achieving the proportional representation of different political parties and voters cast ballots only for political parties, whereas in other forms, voters cast ballots for individual candidates within a political party.<br><br>\nMany countries - both unicameral and bicameral - use a mix of electoral methods, in which a portion of legislative seats are awarded using one system, such as plurality/majority, while the remaining seats are awarded by another system, such as proportional representation. Many countries with bicameral legislatures use different voting systems for the two chambers.","id":"legislative-branch","content":"<strong>description: </strong>formerly a unicameral National Assembly or <em>Assembl&eacute;e Nationale </em>(188 seats; 163 directly elected in multi-seat constituencies by proportional representation vote and 25 directly elected in single-seat constituencies by absolute majority vote with a second round if needed; members serve 4-year terms); note - on 5 October 2021, Interim President Mahamat Idriss DEBY installed 93 members of an interim parliament, called the National Transitional Council (NTC); according to DEBY, the NTC will act as a national assembly of transition until the country&rsquo;s next elections take place<br><br><strong>elections: </strong><p>members of the so called \"National Transitional Council\" were installed by Interim President DEBY on 24 September 2021 (next election NA)</p><br><br><strong>election results: </strong>percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - NA; composition - men 64, women 29, percent of women 31.2%<br><br><strong>note:</strong> the National Assembly mandate was extended to 2020, reportedly due to a lack of funding for the scheduled 2015 election; the MPS has held a majority in the NA since 1997"},{"title":"Judicial branch","comparative":false,"subfields_raw":"highest courts, judge selection and term of office, subordinate courts","field_id":"314","definition":"This entry includes three subfields.

Oil and agriculture are mainstays of Chad’s economy. Oil provides about 60% of export revenues, while cotton, cattle, livestock, and gum arabic provide the bulk of Chad's non-oil export earnings. The services sector contributes less than one-third of GDP and has attracted foreign investment mostly through telecommunications and banking.</p><p></p><p>Nearly all of Chad’s fuel is provided by one domestic refinery, and unanticipated shutdowns occasionally result in shortages. The country regulates the price of domestic fuel, providing an incentive for black market sales.</p><p></p><p>Although high oil prices and strong local harvests supported the economy in the past, low oil prices now stress Chad’s fiscal position and have resulted in significant government cutbacks. Chad relies on foreign assistance and foreign capital for most of its public and private sector investment. Investment in Chad is difficult due to its limited infrastructure, lack of trained workers, extensive government bureaucracy, and corruption. Chad obtained a three-year extended credit facility from the IMF in 2014 and was granted debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative in April 2015.</p><p></p><p>In 2018, economic policy will be driven by efforts that started in 2016 to reverse the recession and to repair damage to public finances and exports. The government is implementing an emergency action plan to counterbalance the drop in oil revenue and to diversify the economy. Chad’s national development plan (NDP) cost just over $9 billion with a financing gap of $6.7 billion. The NDP emphasized the importance of private sector participation in Chad’s development, as well as the need to improve the business environment, particularly in priority sectors such as mining and agriculture.</p><p></p><p>The Government of Chad reached a deal with Glencore and four other banks on the restructuring of a $1.45 billion oil-backed loan in February 2018, after a long negotiation. The new terms include an extension of the maturity to 2030 from 2022, a two-year grace period on principal repayments, and a lower interest rate of the London Inter-bank Offer Rate (Libor) plus 2% - down from Libor plus 7.5%. The original Glencore loan was to be repaid with crude oil assets, however, Chad's oil sales were hit by the downturn in the price of oil. Chad had secured a $312 million credit from the IMF in June 2017, but release of those funds hinged on restructuring the Glencore debt. Chad had already cut public spending to try to meet the terms of the IMF program, but that prompted strikes and protests in a country where nearly 40% of the population lives below the poverty line. Multinational partners, such as the African Development Bank, the EU, and the World Bank are likely to continue budget support in 2018, but Chad will remain at high debt risk, given its dependence on oil revenue and pressure to spend on subsidies and security.</p>"},{"title":"Real GDP (purchasing power parity)","comparative":"144","field_id":"208","definition":"This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. A nation's GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates is the sum value of all goods and services produced in the country valued at prices prevailing in the United States in the year noted. This is the measure most economists prefer when looking at per-capita welfare and when comparing living conditions or use of resources across countries. The measure is difficult to compute, as a US dollar value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent in the United States (for example, the value of an ox-cart or non-US military equipment); as a result, PPP estimates for some countries are based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services. In addition, many countries do not formally participate in the World Bank's PPP project that calculates these measures, so the resulting GDP estimates for these countries may lack precision. For many developing countries, PPP-based GDP measures are multiples of the official exchange rate (OER) measure.

A nation's GDP at official exchange rates (OER) is the home-currency-denominated annual GDP figure divided by the bilateral average US exchange rate with that country in that year. The measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output. Many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-à-vis its neighbors, judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace. Official exchange rates, however, can be artificially fixed and/or subject to manipulation - resulting in claims of the country having an under- or over-valued currency - and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate. Moreover, even if the official exchange rate is market-determined, market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services (the ones the country trades) and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces. Furthermore, OER-converted GDP is not well suited to comparing domestic GDP over time, since appreciation/depreciation from one year to the next will make the OER GDP value rise/fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated GDP changed.","id":"gdp-official-exchange-rate","content":"$10.912 billion (2019 est.)"},{"title":"Inflation rate (consumer prices)","comparative":"7","field_id":"229","definition":"This entry provides the annual inflation rate, as calculated by the percent change in current consumer prices from the previous year's consumer prices.","id":"inflation-rate-consumer-prices","content":"-0.9% (2019 est.)<br><br>4.2% (2018 est.)<br><br>-1.5% (2017 est.)"},{"title":"GDP - composition, by sector of origin","comparative":false,"subfields_raw":"agriculture, industry, services","field_id":"214","definition":"This entry shows where production takes place in an economy.

Earlier editions of <em>The World Factbook</em> referred to this concept as Investment (gross fixed) and that data now have been moved to this new field.<br /><br /><em>investment in inventories</em> consists of net changes to the stock of outputs that are still held by the units that produce them, awaiting further sale to an end user, such as automobiles sitting on a dealer&rsquo;s lot or groceries on the store shelves. This figure may be positive or negative. If the stock of unsold output increases during the relevant time period, <em>investment in inventories</em> is positive, but, if the stock of unsold goods declines, it will be negative. <em>Investment in inventories</em> normally is an early indicator of the state of the economy.

In a purely accounting sense, <em>imports</em> have no direct impact on GDP, which only measures output of the domestic economy. Imports are entered as a negative item to offset the fact that the expenditure figures for consumption, investment, government, and exports also include expenditures on imports. These imports contribute directly to foreign GDP but only indirectly to domestic GDP. Because of this negative offset for imports of goods and services, the sum of the other five items, excluding imports, will always total more than 100 percent of GDP.

The following terms and abbreviations are used throughout the entry: <br />\n<p><strong>2G -</strong>&nbsp;is short for second-generation&nbsp;cellular network. After 2G was launched, the previous mobile wireless network systems were retroactively dubbed&nbsp;1G. While radio signals on 1G networks are&nbsp;analog, radio signals on 2G networks are&nbsp;digital. Both systems use digital signaling to connect the radio towers (which listen to the devices) to the rest of the mobile system.<br /><strong>3G -&nbsp;</strong>is the third generation of&nbsp;wireless&nbsp;mobile telecommunications technology. It is the upgrade for&nbsp;2.5G&nbsp;and&nbsp;2.5G&nbsp;GPRS&nbsp;networks, for faster data transfer. &nbsp;This increased speed is based on a set of standards used for mobile devices and mobile telecommunications use services and networks that comply with the International Mobile Telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000) specifications by the&nbsp;International Telecommunication Union. 3G finds application in wireless voice telephony,&nbsp;mobile Internet&nbsp;access, fixed wireless Internet access, video calls, and mobile TV.<br /><strong>4G -</strong>&nbsp;is the fourth generation of&nbsp;broadband&nbsp;cellular network&nbsp;technology, succeeding&nbsp;3G. The first-release&nbsp;Long Term Evolution&nbsp;(LTE) standard was commercially deployed in&nbsp;Oslo, Norway, and&nbsp;Stockholm, Sweden&nbsp;in 2009, and has since been deployed throughout most parts of the world. Applications, include enhanced mobile web access, IP telephony, high-definition mobile TV, and video conferencing.<br /><strong>5G -</strong>&nbsp;is the fifth generation technology standard for cellular networks, which&nbsp;cellular phone companies&nbsp;began deploying worldwide in 2019; it is the planned successor to the&nbsp;4G&nbsp;networks which provide connectivity to most current&nbsp;cellphones.&nbsp;Like its predecessors, 5G networks are&nbsp;cellular networks, in which the service area is divided into small geographical areas called&nbsp;cells. All 5G wireless devices in a cell are connected to the&nbsp;Internet&nbsp;and&nbsp;telephone network&nbsp;by&nbsp;radio waves&nbsp;through a local&nbsp;antenna&nbsp;in the cell. The main advantage of the new networks is that they will have greater bandwidth, allowing higher download speeds, eventually up to 10 gigabits per second (Gbit/s). Due to the increased bandwidth, the expectation is that the new networks will not just serve cellphones like existing cellular networks, but also be used as general Internet service providers for laptops and desktop computers, competing with existing ISPs such as&nbsp;cable Internet. Existing 4G cellphones will not be able to use the new networks, which will require new 5G-enabled wireless devices.<br /><strong>ADSL -</strong> Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) is a type of digital subscriber line (DSL) that allows faster data transmission via copper service phone lines to a home or business. ADSL provides an &ldquo;always on&rdquo; connection and higher speeds than dial-up Internet can provide. In ADSL, bandwidth and bit rate (i.e., speed) are asymmetric, meaning greater toward the customer (downstream) than the reverse (upstream).<br /><strong>AngoSat 2</strong> - geostationary communications satellite for ground communication and broadcasting infrastructure in Angola, operated by Angosat and built by the Russian company ISS Reshetnev.<br /><strong>Arabsat</strong> - Arab Satellite Communications Organization (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia). <br /><strong>Cellular telephone system</strong> - the telephones in this system are radio transceivers, with each instrument having its own private radio frequency and sufficient radiated power to reach the booster station in its area (cell), from which the telephone signal is fed to a telephone exchange. <br /><strong>Central American Microwave System</strong> - a trunk microwave radio relay system that links the countries of Central America and Mexico with each other. <br /><strong>Coaxial cable</strong> - a multichannel communication cable consisting of a central conducting wire, surrounded by and insulated from a cylindrical conducting shell; a large number of telephone channels can be made available within the insulated space by the use of a large number of carrier frequencies. <br /><strong>DSL - </strong>Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) is a family of technologies that are used to transmit digital data over telephone lines.<br /><strong>e-services</strong> - Electronic services rely on information and communication technologies (ICT); the three main components of e-services are the service provider, service receiver (or customer), and the channel for delivery, generally the Internet. E-services have expanded to e-health, e-commerce, e-fleet, and e-government, among other services. E-services are also linked to the development of IoT and smart city technology.<br /><strong>ECOWAS</strong> telecommunications - Economic Community of West African States regional telecommunications development program, focused on broadband infrastructure, landing of submarine cables, and the establishment of a single liberalized telecoms market.<br /><strong>Eutelsat</strong> - European Telecommunications Satellite Organization (Paris). <br /><strong>Fiber-optic cable</strong> - a multichannel communications cable using a thread of optical glass fibers as a transmission medium in which the signal (voice, video, etc.) is in the form of a coded pulse of light.<br /><strong>FTTX</strong> - Fiber to the x (FTTX) is a generic term for any&nbsp;broadband&nbsp;network architecture using&nbsp;optical fiber&nbsp;to provide all or part of the&nbsp;local loop&nbsp;used for&nbsp;last mile&nbsp;telecommunications. As fiber optic cables are able to carry much more data than copper cables, especially over long distances, copper telephone networks built in the 20th century are being replaced by fiber. FTTX is a general term for several configurations of fiber deployment, broadly organized into two groups: FTTN and FTTP /H/B. Fiber to the node (FTTN), also referred to as Fiber to the neighborhood, delivers fiber to within 300m (1,000 ft) of a customer&rsquo;s premises. Fiber to the premises (FTTP) can be further categorized as fiber to the home (FTTH) or fiber to the building/business (FTTB). FTTN (and FTTC, fiber to the curb (to less than 300m (1,000 ft of a customer&rsquo;s premises)) are seen as interim steps toward full FTTP.<br /><strong>Galileo</strong> - Chartered in 2016, Galileo is a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) created by the European Union through the European Space Agency (ESA), and operated by the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA).

A further improved 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard, Evolved High Speed Packet Access (also known as HSPA+), was released late in 2008 with subsequent worldwide adoption beginning in 2010. The newer standard allows bit-rates to reach as high as 337 Mbit/s in the downlink and 34 Mbit/s in the uplink. However, these speeds are rarely achieved in practice.<br /><strong>ICT </strong>-&nbsp; Information and communications technology (ICT) encompasses the capture, storage, retrieval, processing, display, representation, presentation, organization, management, security, transfer, and interchange of data and information; includes all categories of ubiquitous technology used for the gathering, storing, transmitting, retrieving, or processing of information.<br /><strong>Inmarsat</strong> - International Maritime Satellite Organization is a British satellite telecommunications company, offering global mobile services.

Reliable over-the-horizon communications are realized for distances up to 600 miles in a single hop; additional hops can extend the range of this system for very long distances. <br /><strong>Trunk network</strong> - a network of switching centers, connected by multichannel trunk lines. <br /><strong>UHF</strong> - ultra high frequency; any radio frequency in the 300- to 3,000-MHz range. <br /><strong>VHF</strong> - very high frequency; any radio frequency in the 30- to 300-MHz range.<br /><strong>VNO</strong> - A virtual network operator (VNO) is a management services provider and a network services reseller of other telecommunication service providers. VNOs do not possess a telecom network infrastructure; however, they provide telecom services by acquiring the required capacity from other telecom carriers. These network providers are classified as virtual because they offer network services to clients without possessing the actual network. VNOs usually lease bandwidth at agreed wholesale rates from different telecom providers and then offer solutions to their direct customers.<br /><strong>VOD </strong>- or video on demand is a video media distribution system that allows users to access video entertainment without a traditional video entertainment device and without the constraints of a typical static broadcasting schedule.<br /><strong>Voice over Internet Protocol</strong> - VoIP, also called&nbsp;IP telephony, refers to the delivery of&nbsp;voice communications&nbsp;and&nbsp;multimedia&nbsp;sessions over&nbsp;Internet Protocol&nbsp;(IP) networks, such as the&nbsp;Internet. The terms&nbsp;Internet telephony,&nbsp;broadband telephony, and&nbsp;broadband phone service&nbsp;specifically refer to the provisioning of communications services (voice,&nbsp;fax, text-messaging, voice-messaging) over the public Internet, rather than via the public switched telephone network (PSTN), also known as&nbsp;plain old telephone service&nbsp;(POTS).<br /><strong>VSAT</strong> - a VSAT (very-small-aperture terminal)&nbsp;is a two-way&nbsp;satellite&nbsp;ground station&nbsp;with a&nbsp;dish antenna&nbsp;that is smaller than 3.8 meters. The majority of VSAT antennas range from 75&nbsp;cm to 1.2 m.&nbsp;Data rates, generally, range from 4 kbit/s up to 16 Mbit/s.<br /><strong>WACS</strong> - the&nbsp;West Africa Cable System is a submarine communications cable linking South Africa with the UK along the west coast of Africa and Europe; constructed by Alcatel-Lucent. The cable consists of four fiber pairs and is 14,530 Km in length with 14 landing points &ndash; 12 along the western coast of Africa and 2 in Europe &ndash; with termination in London, UK.<br /><strong>WiMAX -</strong> stands for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access; it is a family of&nbsp;wireless broadband&nbsp;communication standards based on the&nbsp;IEEE 802.16&nbsp;set of standards, which provide multiple physical layer (PHY) and Media Access Control (MAC) options.</p>","id":"telecommunication-systems","content":"<strong>general assessment: </strong>Chad&rsquo;s inadequate telecom infrastructure, corruption, and high taxes hinder penetration in fixed, mobile, and Internet sectors; with tax reform, operators are investing in voice and data infrastructure to 3G/4G; government approved telecom infrastructure upgrade; World Bank-funded Central African Backbone (CAB) project; Trans-Saharan Backbone project will link a fiber cable to Nigeria and Algeria (2020)<br><br><strong>domestic: </strong>fixed-line connections less than 1 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular subscribership base of about 53 per 100 persons (2020)<br><br><strong>international: </strong>country code - 235; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean)<br><br><strong>note:</strong> the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced downturn, particularly in mobile device production; many network operators delayed upgrades to infrastructure; progress towards 5G implementation was postponed or slowed in some countries; consumer spending on telecom services and devices was affected by large-scale job losses and the consequent restriction on disposable incomes; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home became evident, and received some support from governments"},{"title":"Broadcast media","comparative":false,"field_id":"199","definition":"This entry provides information on the approximate number of public and private TV and radio stations in a country, as well as basic information on the availability of satellite and cable TV services.","id":"broadcast-media","content":"1 state-owned TV station; 2 privately-owned TV stations; state-owned radio network, Radiodiffusion Nationale Tchadienne (RNT), operates national and regional stations; over 10 private radio stations; some stations rebroadcast programs from international broadcasters (2017)"},{"title":"Internet country code","comparative":false,"field_id":"202","definition":"This entry includes the two-letter codes maintained by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in the ISO 3166 Alpha-2 list and used by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to establish country-coded top-level domains (ccTLDs).","id":"internet-country-code","content":".td"},{"title":"Internet users","comparative":"113","subfields_raw":"total, percent of population","field_id":"204","definition":"This entry gives the <em>total</em> number of individuals within a country who can access the Internet at home, via any device type (computer or mobile) and connection.

Human trafficking is a multi-dimensional threat, depriving people of their human rights and freedoms, risking global health, promoting social breakdown, inhibiting development by depriving countries of their human capital, and helping fuel the growth of organized crime. In 2000, the US Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), reauthorized several times (the latest in (2019), which provides tools for the US to combat trafficking in persons, both domestically and abroad. One of the law's key components is the creation of the US Department of State's annual <em>Trafficking in Persons Report</em>, which assesses the government response (i.e., the <em>current situation</em>) in some 150 countries with a significant number of victims trafficked across their borders who are recruited, harbored, transported, provided, or obtained for forced labor or sexual exploitation.
