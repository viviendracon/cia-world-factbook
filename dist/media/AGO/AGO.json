A population pyramid illustrates the age and sex structure of a country's population and may provide insights about political and social stability, as well as economic development.

The male and female populations are broken down into 5-year age groups represented as horizontal bars along the vertical axis, with the youngest age groups at the bottom and the oldest at the top.

Flood waters finally receded in May, but not before an estimated 260,000 residents had been affected. Around the city of Ondjiva, in southern Angola, water levels dropped significantly between late March and mid-May. The satellite captured this &quot;after&quot; image of the area on 13 May 2011. Made from a combination of shortwave infrared, near infrared, and red light, these images distinguish between water and land better than natural-color images. Vegetation appears bright green, and water appears bright blue. Thin white lines show embankments, which afforded Ondjiva some protection from the high waters in early 2011.
