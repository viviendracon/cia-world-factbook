At a latitude of about 49 degrees south, the islands lie in the path of the &quot;Furious Fifties,&quot; a belt of westerly winds that whip around the Southern Hemisphere, mostly unimpeded by land.\n\nThe islands were formed over millions of years by a series of lava flows. The perimeter of the large island is carved by fjords, and the rocky landscape is very sparsely vegetated with grasses, mosses, and a plant in the cabbage family.

The highest point on the island is Mount Ross, which has an elevation of 1,850 m; it is also thought to be the youngest volcanic peak on the island.
