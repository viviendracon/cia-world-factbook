The male and female populations are broken down into 5-year age groups represented as horizontal bars along the vertical axis, with the youngest age groups at the bottom and the oldest at the top.

The fort was originally built in 1843 to encourage colonization in Southern Chile, protect the Strait of Magellan, and ward off claims by other nations. Harsh weather prevented large-scale settlement and in 1848 the government founded Punta Arenas to the north; the fort was abandoned and burned. Between 1941 and 1943, it was reconstructed and in 1968 became a national monument.","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/b5617c87d41d75c3720784b5f55a5182/Chile__Fuerte_Bulnes.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/the-world-factbook/static/b5617c87d41d75c3720784b5f55a5182/f143c/Chile__Fuerte_Bulnes.jpg","srcSet":"/the-world-factbook/static/b5617c87d41d75c3720784b5f55a5182/23e84/Chile__Fuerte_Bulnes.jpg 17w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/b5617c87d41d75c3720784b5f55a5182/2decf/Chile__Fuerte_Bulnes.jpg 34w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/b5617c87d41d75c3720784b5f55a5182/f143c/Chile__Fuerte_Bulnes.jpg 67w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/b5617c87d41d75c3720784b5f55a5182/b5e8f/Chile__Fuerte_Bulnes.jpg 134w","sizes":"(min-width: 67px) 67px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":67,"height":100}}}}},{"position":9,"caption":"View of Easter Island from space.

The high plains (3000-5000 m, 13,000-19,000 ft) of the Andes Mountains, also known as the Puna, appear in the foreground, with a line of young volcanoes (dashed line) facing the much lower Atacama Desert (1000-2000 m elevation). Several salt-crusted dry lakes (known as salars in Spanish) occupy the basins between major thrust faults in the Puna. Salar de Arizaro (foreground) is the largest of the dry lakes in this view. The Atlantic Ocean coastline, where Argentina&apos;s capital city of Buenos Aires sits along the R&#xed;o de la Plata, is dimly visible at image top left. Near image center, the transition (solid line) between two distinct geological zones, the Puna and the Sierras Pampeanas, creates a striking landscape contrast. Compared to the Puna, the Sierras Pampeanas mountains are lower in elevation and have fewer young volcanoes. Sharp-crested ridges are separated by wide, low valleys in this region. The Salinas Grandes - ephemeral shallow salt lakes - occupies one of these valleys. The general color change from reds and browns in the foreground to blues and greens in the upper part of the image reflects the major climatic regions: the deserts of the Atacama and Puna versus the grassy plains of central Argentina, where rainfall is sufficient to promote lush prairie grass, known locally as the pampas. The Salinas Grandes mark an intermediate, semiarid region.
