The falls come from Yosemite Creek, rushing in the spring from snow melt. The upper fall plunges some 436 m (1,430 ft) from the valley rim, making it alone among the 20 highest falls in the world. The combined drop of 739 m (2,425 ft) for the upper fall, middle cascades, and lower fall make Yosemite Falls the highest measured falls in the United States.","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/78dab72a532d78c95387761b7cf94af4/US_135_large.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#283878","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/the-world-factbook/static/78dab72a532d78c95387761b7cf94af4/1583e/US_135_large.jpg","srcSet":"/the-world-factbook/static/78dab72a532d78c95387761b7cf94af4/616ea/US_135_large.jpg
