[{"position":0,"caption":"This is the population pyramid for Libya. A population pyramid illustrates the age and sex structure of a country's population and may provide insights about political and social stability, as well as economic development. The population is distributed along the horizontal axis, with males shown on the left and females on the right. The male and female populations are broken down into 5-year age groups represented as horizontal bars along the vertical axis, with the youngest age groups at the bottom and the oldest at the top. The shape of the population pyramid gradually evolves over time based on fertility, mortality, and international migration trends. <br/><br/>For additional information, please see the entry for Population pyramid on the Definitions and Notes page.","category":"Image","type":"image","fieldId":"341","full":{"id":"cG9zdDoxODYyNjU=","altText":"2022 population pyramid","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/e857ffd71cc8843ffcf44ed9cc29fcc7/LY_popgraph2022.jpeg","childImageSharp":{"original":{"height":350,"width":600},"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/the-world-factbook/static/e857ffd71cc8843ffcf44ed9cc29fcc7/2b9a8/LY_popgraph2022.jpg","srcSet":"/the-world-factbook/static/e857ffd71cc8843ffcf44ed9cc29fcc7/4cc40/LY_popgraph2022.jpg 150w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/e857ffd71cc8843ffcf44ed9cc29fcc7/8c10b/LY_popgraph2022.jpg 300w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/e857ffd71cc8843ffcf44ed9cc29fcc7/2b9a8/LY_popgraph2022.jpg 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":600,"height":350}}}},"thumb":{"altText":"2022 population pyramid","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/e857ffd71cc8843ffcf44ed9cc29fcc7/LY_popgraph2022.jpeg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/the-world-factbook/static/e857ffd71cc8843ffcf44ed9cc29fcc7/083f1/LY_popgraph2022.jpg","srcSet":"/the-world-factbook/static/e857ffd71cc8843ffcf44ed9cc29fcc7/172cf/LY_popgraph2022.jpg 43w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/e857ffd71cc8843ffcf44ed9cc29fcc7/4d637/LY_popgraph2022.jpg 86w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/e857ffd71cc8843ffcf44ed9cc29fcc7/083f1/LY_popgraph2022.jpg 171w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/e857ffd71cc8843ffcf44ed9cc29fcc7/1bcce/LY_popgraph2022.jpg 342w","sizes":"(min-width: 171px) 171px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":171,"height":100}}}}},{"position":0,"caption":"","category":"Document","type":"document","fieldId":"401","full":{"id":"cG9zdDoxODEwMDU=","altText":"MENA religious affiliation","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/7d32d01febbf043f3142d920da02366e/Middle_East_Religion_graphic_FINAL_WFB_2015-15.pdf","childImageSharp":null}},"thumb":{"altText":"MENA religious affiliation","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/7d32d01febbf043f3142d920da02366e/Middle_East_Religion_graphic_FINAL_WFB_2015-15.pdf","childImageSharp":null}}},{"position":0,"caption":"Arabic audio sample","category":"Audio","type":"audio","fieldId":"402","full":{"id":"cG9zdDoxODA3OTU=","altText":"Arabic audio sample","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/75d33021878a03953bb0cfe236a612e9/Arabic-15.mp3","childImageSharp":null}},"thumb":{"altText":"Arabic audio sample","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/75d33021878a03953bb0cfe236a612e9/Arabic-15.mp3","childImageSharp":null}}},{"position":0,"caption":"","category":"Document","type":"document","fieldId":"349","full":{"id":"cG9zdDoxNzk4ODc=","altText":"total population growth rate v. urban population growth rate, 2000-2030","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/fe0bfd6753d3d1eef56d0541f0005e1a/urban_LY.pdf","childImageSharp":null}},"thumb":{"altText":"total population growth rate v. urban population growth rate, 2000-2030","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/fe0bfd6753d3d1eef56d0541f0005e1a/urban_LY.pdf","childImageSharp":null}}},{"position":0,"caption":"<p>about 2.5 times the size of Texas;

Geologists think that the draa of the Marzuq were probably formed by winds different from the prevailing north-northeast winds of today. Numerous smaller dunes have developed on the backs of the draa. Three distinct dune types are visible: longitudinal dunes, which are more or less parallel with the north winds; transverse dunes, which are usually more curved and formed at right angles to the wind; and star dunes, in which several linear arms converge towards a single peak.
