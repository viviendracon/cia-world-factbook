The male and female populations are broken down into 5-year age groups represented as horizontal bars along the vertical axis, with the youngest age groups at the bottom and the oldest at the top.

Instead of beginning in February, the rainy season did not start until March, and steady rains did not begin until late March. Though the rain had started to alleviate the drought, vegetation was still depressed in parts of Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) between 22 March and 6 April 2007, when NASA's Terra satellite captured the data used to make this photo. The image compared vegetation at that time to average conditions recorded since 2000. Areas where plants were growing more slowly or more sparsely than average showed up as brown, while areas where vegetation was denser than average were green. The brown tint dominating the image indicates that plants through most of the country were more sparse than normal. The three major rivers that cross the country from north to south are all but invisible leaving only central Lake Kossou conspicuous as a major water body. Among the crops affected by the lack of rain was West Africa's cocoa crop. About 70 percent of the world's cocoa comes from West Africa and Cote d'Ivoire is a top grower.
