In southern China, just north of the border with Nepal, one unnamed Himalayan glacier flows from southwest to northeast, creeping down a valley terminating in a glacial lake. Shown in this natural-color satellite image, mountains on either side of the glacier cast long shadows to the northwest. From a bowl-shaped cirque, the glacier flows downhill. Where the ice passes over especially steep terrain, ripple marks on the glacier surface indicate the icefall. Northeast of the icefall, the glacier&apos;s surface is mostly smooth for several kilometers until a network of crevasses mark the surface. At the end of the glacier&apos;s deeply crevassed snout sits a glacial lake, coated with ice in this wintertime picture.
