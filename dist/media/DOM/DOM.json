The facade of the building has a bell tower and the Dominican Coat of Arms sculpted above the door.","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/6e1924471b1cbb7d147d92d27b13e4fa/National_Pantheon.jpeg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/the-world-factbook/static/6e1924471b1cbb7d147d92d27b13e4fa/e0e16/National_Pantheon.jpg","srcSet":"/the-world-factbook/static/6e1924471b1cbb7d147d92d27b13e4fa/dbafd/National_Pantheon.jpg 19w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/6e1924471b1cbb7d147d92d27b13e4fa/e9359/National_Pantheon.jpg 38w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/6e1924471b1cbb7d147d92d27b13e4fa/e0e16/National_Pantheon.jpg 75w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/6e1924471b1cbb7d147d92d27b13e4fa/f90ed/National_Pantheon.jpg 150w","sizes":"(min-width: 75px) 75px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":75,"height":100}}}}},{"position":3,"caption":"The Cathedral of Santa María la Menor is in the Colonial City of Santo Domingo.
