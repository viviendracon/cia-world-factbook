A population pyramid illustrates the age and sex structure of a country's population and may provide insights about political and social stability, as well as economic development. The population is distributed along the horizontal axis, with males shown on the left and females on the right. The male and female populations are broken down into 5-year age groups represented as horizontal bars along the vertical axis, with the youngest age groups at the bottom and the oldest at the top. The shape of the population pyramid gradually evolves over time based on fertility, mortality, and international migration trends. <br/><br/>For additional information, please see the entry for Population pyramid on the Definitions and Notes page.","category":"Image","type":"image","fieldId":"341","full":{"id":"cG9zdDoxODYxNjU=","altText":"2022 population pyramid","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/5c47dc1e0cf2407ab9ad9367bd236bd4/BH_popgraph2022.jpeg","childImageSharp":{"original":{"height":350,"width":600},"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/the-world-factbook/static/5c47dc1e0cf2407ab9ad9367bd236bd4/2b9a8/BH_popgraph2022.jpg","srcSet":"/the-world-factbook/static/5c47dc1e0cf2407ab9ad9367bd236bd4/4cc40/BH_popgraph2022.jpg 150w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/5c47dc1e0cf2407ab9ad9367bd236bd4/8c10b/BH_popgraph2022.jpg 300w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/5c47dc1e0cf2407ab9ad9367bd236bd4/2b9a8/BH_popgraph2022.jpg 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":600,"height":350}}}},"thumb":{"altText":"2022 population pyramid","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/5c47dc1e0cf2407ab9ad9367bd236bd4/BH_popgraph2022.jpeg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/the-world-factbook/static/5c47dc1e0cf2407ab9ad9367bd236bd4/083f1/BH_popgraph2022.jpg","srcSet":"/the-world-factbook/static/5c47dc1e0cf2407ab9ad9367bd236bd4/172cf/BH_popgraph2022.jpg 43w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/5c47dc1e0cf2407ab9ad9367bd236bd4/4d637/BH_popgraph2022.jpg 86w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/5c47dc1e0cf2407ab9ad9367bd236bd4/083f1/BH_popgraph2022.jpg 171w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/5c47dc1e0cf2407ab9ad9367bd236bd4/1bcce/BH_popgraph2022.jpg 342w","sizes":"(min-width: 171px) 171px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":171,"height":100}}}}},{"position":0,"caption":"","category":"Audio","type":"audio","fieldId":"322","full":{"id":"cG9zdDoxODM4NDk=","altText":"This is an audio of the National Anthem for Belize.
