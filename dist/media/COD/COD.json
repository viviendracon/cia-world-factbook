[{"position":0,"caption":"This is the population pyramid for Democratic Republic of the Congo. A population pyramid illustrates the age and sex structure of a country's population and may provide insights about political and social stability, as well as economic development. The population is distributed along the horizontal axis, with males shown on the left and females on the right. The male and female populations are broken down into 5-year age groups represented as horizontal bars along the vertical axis, with the youngest age groups at the bottom and the oldest at the top. The shape of the population pyramid gradually evolves over time based on fertility, mortality, and international migration trends. <br/><br/>For additional information, please see the entry for Population pyramid on the Definitions and Notes page.","category":"Image","type":"image","fieldId":"341","full":{"id":"cG9zdDoxODYxODA=","altText":"2022 population pyramid","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/5b5f4f2130ecddb3aa5cad5374839b86/CG_popgraph2022.jpeg","childImageSharp":{"original":{"height":350,"width":600},"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/the-world-factbook/static/5b5f4f2130ecddb3aa5cad5374839b86/2b9a8/CG_popgraph2022.jpg","srcSet":"/the-world-factbook/static/5b5f4f2130ecddb3aa5cad5374839b86/4cc40/CG_popgraph2022.jpg 150w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/5b5f4f2130ecddb3aa5cad5374839b86/8c10b/CG_popgraph2022.jpg 300w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/5b5f4f2130ecddb3aa5cad5374839b86/2b9a8/CG_popgraph2022.jpg 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":600,"height":350}}}},"thumb":{"altText":"2022 population pyramid","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/5b5f4f2130ecddb3aa5cad5374839b86/CG_popgraph2022.jpeg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/the-world-factbook/static/5b5f4f2130ecddb3aa5cad5374839b86/083f1/CG_popgraph2022.jpg","srcSet":"/the-world-factbook/static/5b5f4f2130ecddb3aa5cad5374839b86/172cf/CG_popgraph2022.jpg 43w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/5b5f4f2130ecddb3aa5cad5374839b86/4d637/CG_popgraph2022.jpg 86w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/5b5f4f2130ecddb3aa5cad5374839b86/083f1/CG_popgraph2022.jpg 171w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/5b5f4f2130ecddb3aa5cad5374839b86/1bcce/CG_popgraph2022.jpg 342w","sizes":"(min-width: 171px) 171px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":171,"height":100}}}}},{"position":0,"caption":"","category":"Document","type":"document","fieldId":"349","full":{"id":"cG9zdDoxODQyNTk=","altText":"total population growth rate v. urban population growth rate, 2000-2030","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/6e1337f10f570d91da588b3b8ea990a0/urban_CG.pdf","childImageSharp":null}},"thumb":{"altText":"total population growth rate v. urban population growth rate, 2000-2030","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/6e1337f10f570d91da588b3b8ea990a0/urban_CG.pdf","childImageSharp":null}}},{"position":0,"caption":"Lingala audio sample","category":"Audio","type":"audio","fieldId":"402","full":{"id":"cG9zdDoxODQyNTY=","altText":"Lingala audio sample","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/9fb9ff809bff04ab891f50ee99fb795a/Lingala-1.mp3","childImageSharp":null}},"thumb":{"altText":"Lingala audio sample","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/9fb9ff809bff04ab891f50ee99fb795a/Lingala-1.mp3","childImageSharp":null}}},{"position":0,"caption":"<p>slightly less than one-fourth the size of the US</p>","category":"Image","type":"image","fieldId":"280","full":{"id":"cG9zdDoxODQyNTU=","altText":"Area comparison map","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/e616b2ea97b0cf4571bcea8cad2708ee/CG_area.jpg","childImageSharp":{"original":{"height":574,"width":600},"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8e8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/the-world-factbook/static/e616b2ea97b0cf4571bcea8cad2708ee/8ccc0/CG_area.jpg","srcSet":"/the-world-factbook/static/e616b2ea97b0cf4571bcea8cad2708ee/6c58d/CG_area.jpg 150w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/e616b2ea97b0cf4571bcea8cad2708ee/abcd0/CG_area.jpg 300w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/e616b2ea97b0cf4571bcea8cad2708ee/8ccc0/CG_area.jpg 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":600,"height":574}}}},"thumb":{"altText":"Area comparison map","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/e616b2ea97b0cf4571bcea8cad2708ee/CG_area.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8e8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/the-world-factbook/static/e616b2ea97b0cf4571bcea8cad2708ee/10443/CG_area.jpg","srcSet":"/the-world-factbook/static/e616b2ea97b0cf4571bcea8cad2708ee/5487e/CG_area.jpg 26w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/e616b2ea97b0cf4571bcea8cad2708ee/3108a/CG_area.jpg 53w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/e616b2ea97b0cf4571bcea8cad2708ee/10443/CG_area.jpg 105w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/e616b2ea97b0cf4571bcea8cad2708ee/8e6ce/CG_area.jpg 210w","sizes":"(min-width: 105px) 105px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":105,"height":100}}}}},{"position":7,"caption":"Traffic on the way to the airport in Kinshasa.

Lake Kivu is approximately 90 km long and 50 km wide, with a maximum depth of 475 m and mean depth of 220 m. About 1,370 sq km or 58% of the lake's waters lie within the DRC's borders. The lake bed sits upon a rift valley that is slowly being pulled apart, causing volcanic activity in the area. The city of Goma lies on the lake shore, only 13–18 km south of the active Nyiragongo Volcano.","localFile":{"publicURL":"/the-world-factbook/static/ce95747281f9402a3f244733d7e1036a/CONGODR_2.jpg","childImageSharp":{"original":{"height":382,"width":600},"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8c8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/the-world-factbook/static/ce95747281f9402a3f244733d7e1036a/2f7ba/CONGODR_2.jpg","srcSet":"/the-world-factbook/static/ce95747281f9402a3f244733d7e1036a/37931/CONGODR_2.jpg 150w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/ce95747281f9402a3f244733d7e1036a/158cd/CONGODR_2.jpg 300w,\n/the-world-factbook/static/ce95747281f9402a3f244733d7e1036a/2f7ba/CONGODR_2.jpg 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":600,"height":382}}}},"thumb":{"altText":"Lake Kivu, the city of Goma, and Mount Nyirangongo.
